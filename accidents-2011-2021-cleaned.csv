There were 126 passengers and eight crew members on board. The airplane operated on a flight KGL348 from Surgut Airport (SGC) to Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME).Three passengers died and about 32 were seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed by fire.Initial reports indicate that the airplane had been towed to the main taxiway for engine startup. A short circuit occurred while the AC generators were connected to the aircraft's electrical system after start-up of the engines. A fire erupted in the rear, spreading quickly through the main cabin. The crew shut down the engines and initiated an evacuation. The Interstate Aviation Committee reported that engines no. 1, 2 and 3 and the APU were not the source of the fire. The fire started in the rear of the aircraft in the area of frames 62-65.The cause of the fire was an electrical arc produced by electrical currents exceeding ten to twenty times the nominal loads when two generators not synchronised with each other were brought online but got connected together instead of being connected to parallel busses.The unsynchronised operation of the generators can be attributed to- Poor technical conditions of contacts TKS233DOD responsible for connecting the generators with the electrical busses, that were damaged by prolonged operation without maintenance. A contact normally open was welded and fractured insulation material moved between contacts that are normally closed. These abnormal contact positions led to the connection between #2 and #3 generators.- Differences in the schematic diagrams of generator 2 and generators 1 and 3. When the switch is moved from ""check"" to ""enable"" with no delay in the ""neutral"" position generator 2 is brought online without time delay which leads to increased wear of normally closed contacts in the TKS233DOD unit.- The specific design of the electrical systems to ensure power supply to each bus from either the APU or either engine integrated drive generator.01-01-201101-01-201101-01-201130 NOV 1983CCCP-85588Aeroflot / MagadanJUN 1993RA-85588AeroflotOCT 1994RA-85588Magadan AviaAUG 1999RA-85588Vladivostok AirAPR 2007RA-85588Kogalymavia",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2011

No injuries occurred during the event. The flight landed uneventfully at Toronto-Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada, where damage to the tail skid was discovered. Further damage to the aft pressure bulkhead was later discovered, and this damage was determined to be substantial.According to the captain, normal procedures were followed during preflight and taxi, including verification of the takeoff bug speeds. During the takeoff roll, the automatic, aircraft-generated V1 callout occurred and he began to rotate the airplane. The first officer did not call for rotation at that time. The captain applied nose up pitch command until he realized the indicated airspeed was too low. He said he then eased the nose of the airplane back down to the runway and re-rotated at the normal rotation speed, achieving approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155 to 160 knots. The FO said he noticed that the automatic voice callout occurred about 20 knots early and observed the captain rotate for takeoff, but he said nothing to the captain for fear of causing confusion. The rest of the climbout, cruise, descent, and landing at Toronto was uneventful.According to the first officer, during preflight preparations, due to a last minute runway change, the takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload into the flight management computer (FMC), so he manually entered the speeds using information on the preflight paperwork. Flight planning data indicated that the airplane takeoff weight was 161,037 pounds with a center of gravity at 22.5% mean aerodynamic chord, which under the conditions at the time of the accident should have resulted in a flaps 1 takeoff with V1 (takeoff decision speed) of 153 knots, a Vr (rotation speed) also of 153 knots, and V2 (scheduled takeoff speed) of 158 knots. The recorded data indicates the manually entered V speeds in the FMC were V1 123 knots, Vr 153 knots and V2 158 knots.Probable causeThe early rotation of the airplane to an angle at which the fuselage contacted the runway. Contributing to early rotation was the Captains reaction to the erroneous V1 automated callout, likely assuming that the airplane was at or close to the correct Vr at the same time. The erroneous automated callout was likely due to a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering takeoff data for a newly assigned departure runway.",International Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2011

All four passengers and two crew members survived. The airplane operated on Priester Aviation flight 800 from Chicago-Midway Airport, IL (MDW) to Springfield-Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport, IL (SPI).The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. The airplane accumulated a trace of rime ice during the descent and approach. The airframe anti-icing system was turned off upon intercepting the ILS glide slope, which was shortly before descending below the cloud layer. The copilot was the pilot flying at the time of the accident. He used the autopilot for the initial portion of the approach and then hand flew the airplane after breaking out of the clouds. The pilot stated that the master warning and stick shaker activated when the airplane was on short final. The airplane impacted left of the runway centerline before it ultimately departed the right side of the runway pavement. The airplane crossed a slight rise before coming to rest in the grass. A small fire was quickly put out by military staff, both pilots received minor back injuries, and there were no injuries among the four passengers.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilots decision to conduct an instrument approach in icing conditions without the anti-ice system activated, contrary to the airplane flight manual guidance, which resulted in an inadvertent aerodynamic stall due to an in-flight accumulation of airframe icing.""06-01-2011",Executive,NTSB ,2011

All four passengers and two crew members were not injured. The airplane operated on Hageland flight 161 from Bethel Airport, AK (BET) to Kipnuk Airport, AK (KPN).Following a normal approach to runway 33, the captain landed long to avoid a bump in the runway. As the airplane touched down on the runway, he applied brakes and moved the propeller into beta. During the landing roll, he realized the airplane was still traveling fast, and he did not have enough area to abort the landing, so he applied maximum brakes. The airplane continued off the departure end (north side) of runway 33, and impacted a ditch, which resulted in the airplane coming to rest right wing and nose low. The captain said that at the time of the accident, the runway contained packed snow and ice.Examination of the airplane by the captain revealed that the right wing was bent upwards about 3 to 4 feet inboard from the wingtip.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilots decision to land long on the icy snow-covered runway, resulting in a runway excursion and collision with terrain.""06-01-201106-01-201106-01-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2011

He tried unsuccessfully to stop and start them. The captain decided to abort the flight.He asked the co-pilot to extend the landing gear. During the extension sequence, the aircraft suffered a total electrical failure. The lighting conditions in the cockpit were then very dark and the crew had difficulty in reading the instrument displays. The captain asked the co-pilot to shine a flashlight on the instruments. He briefly saw the threshold of runway 31R. The co-pilot suggested that he go around as he was unsure that the gear was locked down. During the aerodrome circuit at low height the co-pilot continued extending the landing gear manually. The emergency landing being imminent, the co-pilot stopped doing this, even though he was unsure that the gear was locked down because he didnt feel enough resistance to indicate that the gear was extended and locked down.

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. The flight originated at Brasília-Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, DF (BSB).During a VOR approach to runway 32 in heavy rain, the airplane impacted Santo Antônio Hill, 11 km short of the runway.Contributing Factors (translated from Portuguese)- Obesity - undeterminedFactors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle, associated with the high workload in the moments before the collision with the hill, may have contributed to the fact that the task requirement in the final approach exceeded safety margins, leading to a wrong decision of the pilot.- Attitude - unspecifiedIn facing adverse weather conditions and knowing that previous landing aircraft had better visibility at altitude below 3,500 feet in the final approach of the VOR procedure, the pilot may have raised the level of confidence in the situation to the point of continuing descent without considering the risk involved.- Emotional state - undeterminedThe conditions that were present in the final phase of the flight may have raised the level of tension in the cabin to the point of compromising the management of the situation by the pilot, who left the task of communicating to the passenger.- Decision-making processWhen considering that the pilot decided to descend from the minimum altitude to achieve visual conditions, it can be assumed that his decision, probably influenced by the experiences of previous aircraft, was made without adequately assessing the risks involved and without considering the option of flying IFR, taking in view of local weather.In addition, the pilot's decision-making process may have been compromised by the lack of information about the Morro de Santo Antônio in the approach letter - publication of aid for the pilot in flight.- Adverse weather conditions - contributedThe images provided by the primary radar of the Anápolis Control (APP-AN) indicated the existence of strong cloudiness associated with heavy formations in the final approach of the VOR procedure. These conditions influenced the occurrence, causing the collision of the aircraft against the Morro de Santo Antônio, independently of the hypotheses raised in the investigation.- Navigation deviation - contributedThe final approach on course 320 ° (instead of the expected 325 °) led the aircraft to line up with the hill where the collision occurred.- ATS Publication - undefinedMorro de Santo Antônio, an obstacle to control the final approach in which the aircraft collision occurred, was not identified in the VOR approach letter for lane 32, as anticipated by CIRTRAF 100-30, a fact that may have contributed to a possible reduction of situational awareness.",Executive,CENIPA ,2011

The captain attributed the smoke trailing from the left engine to the age of the airplane. The crew then switched frequencies to San Juan Combined En Route Approach Control (San Juan CERAP). Upon receiving a message from the local controller at Saint Thomas, CERAP reported to the flight crew that flames were now observed on the left hand engine.After being notified of the fire, the co-pilot reported they checked the engine instruments and did not have any indication of a fire. About that time the owner of the company who was airborne in another airplane told them they needed to return. The captain ordered the co-pilot to go into the cabin to visually look at the left engine and after returning to the cockpit informed the captain there was a fire.

The airplane operated on Manx2 flight NM7100 from Belfast City Airport (BHD) to Cork Airport (ORK). Following a fuel uplift a total fuel quantity of 3000 lb (1360 kg) was recorded, which was sufficient for the planned round trip to Cork and back to Belfast. The flight plan specified Waterford Airport (EIWF) as the alternate for the sector to Cork.The accident flight took off from Belfast at 0810 hrs, and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 120. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF) with the commander acting as Pilot Non Flying (PNF). At 0848 the flight contacted Cork Approach Control. The Cork ATIS information stated that runway 35 was the active runway with Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) in operation. Cork Approach also informed the flight crew that runway 35 was the active runway with CAT II available for runway 17.

Flight 7100 was given the choice of runways, and while runway 35 was initially considered by the flight crew, a decision was made to opt for an approach to runway 17. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who stated ""...thats copied, just check IRVRs Runway 17 for CAT II, currently at 350, 350, and 450."" The aircraft first established on the ILS approach to runway 17 at 0858 and was handed over to Cork Tower. The RVRs passed by Cork Tower at 0900 hrs were 300/400/375. The approach was continued beyond the 3.5 nautical miles (nm) DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 0903 hrs, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 101 ft radio altitude.A second ILS approach was then flown, to the reciprocal direction runway 35, with the aircraft being handed over to Cork Tower at 09.10 at 8 nm from touchdown. At 091056 the flight crew reported established on the ILS runway 35. The RVRs passed by the Tower at this time were 350/350/350. Descent was continued beyond the 4.9 nm DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 0914, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 91 ft radio altitude.At 0915 hrs the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern for 15 to 20 minutes to see if the weather would improve. The flight took up the holding pattern at point ROVAL maintaining an altitude of 3,000 ft. The flight crew requested the weather for Waterford. This weather, which was below minima, was provided by Cork Approach. The flight crew nominated Shannon Airport as their second alternate and requested weather information. Shannon weather was passed by Cork Approach, it was below minima. Weather for Dublin Airport was then sought by the flight crew. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who offered to provide the weather for Kerry Airport also. The weather at Kerry was passed with the visibility being reported as greater than 10 kilometres. Weather conditions at Dublin, which were marginal, were obtained and passed to the flight crew at 0935 hrs.At approximately 0932 hrs, with EC-ITP still in the ROVAL hold, the RVR values on runway 17 at Cork began to improve. Following a further improvement to 500/450/400 at 0939 hrs, the flight crew elected to attempt another approach to runway 17. At 0945 the aircraft reported established on the ILS, and was configured with landing gear down and 1/2 flaps selected. At 094526, when EC-ITP was at 11 nm DME on the ILS, the RVR (touchdown) improved to 550 m, which was passed to the flight crew by Cork Approach.At 094538, the flight was handed over to the Cork Tower and the flight crew reported to the Tower at 094600 passing 9 nm DME. The final RVRs passed to EC-ITP at 09.4615 were 500/400/400 when the aircraft was 9.6 nm from the threshold of runway 17. At approximately 400 ft radio altitude, recorded data shows the aircraft deviated to the right of the runway centreline, paralleling the centreline track.The descent was continued below Decision Height (DH). Power was reduced momentarily before being re-applied. Just below 100 ft radio altitude, a go-around was called by the PNF and was acknowledged by the PF. Recorded data shows that the aircraft rolled significantly to the left as the aircraft tracked towards the runway centreline. This was immediately followed by a rapid roll to the right which brought the right wingtip into contact with the runway surface. Runway surface contact was made with a roll angle of 97 degrees to the right. The initial impact mark was located 86 m from the runway threshold, and 2 m left of the centreline. The aircraft continued to roll rapidly to the right and struck the runway in the fully inverted position 25 m beyond the initial impact point. The inverted aircraft departed the runway surface on a heading of approximately 195° M and came to a rest 189 m from the initial impact point. The propeller blades on both engines were severely damaged; three of the four propeller blades on the right-hand engine detached during the inverted impact. Fire occurred in both engines post impact. The AOC of the operator contained approval for the aircraft to operate CAT I approaches only. In this case a decision height of 200 feet at an RVR (touchdown) minimum of 550 m for runway 17 and 750 m for runway 35.The Investigation determined that the probable cause was Loss of control during an attempted go-around initiated below Decision Height (200 feet) in Instrument Meteorological Conditions.The Investigation identified the following factors as being significant- The approach was continued in conditions of poor visibility below those required.- The descent was continued below the Decision Height without adequate visual reference being acquired.- Uncoordinated operation of the flight and engine controls when go-around was attempted- The engine power-levers were retarded below the normal in-flight operational range, an action prohibited in flight.- A power difference between the engines became significant when the engine power levers were retarded below the normal in-flight range.- Tiredness and fatigue on the part of the Flight Crew members.- Inadequate command training and checking.- Inappropriate pairing of Flight Crew members, and- Inadequate oversight of the remote Operation by the Operator and the State of the Operator.10-02-201110-02-201110-02-201110-02-2011OCT 1991N3003TFairchild AircraftSEP 1992XA-SESAéromexicoSEP 1992XA-SESAerolitoralSEP 2003ZS-PDWNorse Air Charter22 JAN 2004EC-ITPTop Fly21 MAY 2004EC-ITPTop FlyMAY 2008EC-ITPLíneas Aéreas de Andalucía (op. by Euro Continental Air)MAY 2008EC-ITPManx2NOV 2009EC-ITP Ibertour Servicios Aéreos2011EC-ITPManx2",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIU ,2011

All five on board were killed. The airplane departed from Batam-Hang Nadim Airport (BTH) at 1318 for a test flight following an engine replacement to the engine number one. The test flight was conducted over Bintan (Tanjung Pinang) Island area. There were five persons on board consisted of two pilots, and three company engineers.The flight climbed to the en route cruising altitude of 4000 feet, heading for Tanjung Pinang-Kidjang Airport (TNJ). The airplane crashed nose down in the jungle at the 010 radial of the TPG VOR at a distance of about 15 NM from the VOR.Factors contributed to the accident are as follows- The flight test was not properly well prepared; there was no flight test plan.- The current and applicable CMM is dissimilar the According to the CASA 212-100 and Garrett TPE331-5 Maintenance Manuals related to flight test requirement after the change of only one engine.- The left engine was shut down using normal/ ground shut down procedure. It used the fuel shut off switches off followed by pulling the Power Lever rearward to reverse, as indicated by the propeller pitch.- The right engine most likely shut down by wind milling prior the impact, it was indicated the propellers piston distance position to the cylinder was about normal flight range position and no indication of rotating impact on the blades.- The Casa Service Bulletin No. 212-76-07 Revision 1 issued dated 23 December 1991 (Anti Reverse) that applicable for Casa 212 -100/200, was not incorporated to this aircraft.- The PIC with pareses or paralysis vestibular organ or system could not response normally to the three dimensional motion or movement.

All 12 passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The airplane operated on Central American Airways flight 731 from San Pedro Sula (SAP) to Tegucigalpa (TGU).The flight had departed San Pedro Sula at 0704 for the forty minute flight to Tegucigalpa. The pilot flying deviated from the airways without clearance from air traffic control. At 0734 the controller at Toncontin Airport cleared the flight direct to the 15 DME fix (final approach fix) for a VOR/DME approach to runway 20 and to descend to 9000 feet. At 0751 the fight reported that they were performing a missed approach, after which the flight was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. The airplane was lined up with runway 02 and descending with full flaps, when at about 12 km from the runway the airplane stalled. The descent could not be arrested and the airplane impacted a wooded hillside at an elevation of 5412 ft.PROBABLE CAUSES (translated from original Spanish language report) 1) Weather conditions existing at the time of the event, during the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and a major change in wind speed could cause a stall. The altitude at which the windshear occured, and the reaction time of the pilot and the responsiveness of the aircraft determined whether the descent could be arrested in time to avoid an accident. 2) No published descent procedures were performed, possibly misinterpretation of Flight Instruments (altimeter, airspeed indicator). 3) During the descent to the VOR/DME for runway 20 and 02, the pilot in command (PIC) did not check his approach chart, and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course. 4) There was no adequate communication between crew; deficient CRM (No approach briefing was made for any of the two approaches). 5) The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down (flap 42) at a very long distance from the track without having it in sight. It is noteworthy that the aircraft will not respond to an adverse condition windshear as it appeared at that time with such a configuration. It should be noted that in both approaches it is mandatory to perdorm a ""circuling"" procedure.14-02-20111991CCCP-67673Aeroflot1992OK-WDPLet ?1 DEC 1993J2-KBFPuntavia1994J2-KBFSomali Air Services1997OK-WDPLetDEC 1997LV-WYVOrion2001S9-TBYAerotec International21 FEB 2002D-CLETAerotec InternationalSEP 2002D-CLETAntaresAUG 2007HH-AVPDEC 2007HR-AUQCentral American Airways",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2011

The airplane incurred substantial left wing damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during the overrun. The purpose of the flight was a test flight following the installation of the airplane's interior prior to delivery of the airplane to its owner. The flight departed from Appleton about 1010. The flight returned about three hours later.While the airplane was inside the final approach fix, an amber left side hydraulic quantity low crew alerting system (CAS) message illuminated. The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot flying's (PF) decision to land on a shorter-than-recommended runway with a known left hydraulic system failure rather than go around as suggested by the pilot-not-flying, his failure to immediately apply emergency brakes following the detection of the lack of normal brakes, and his attempt to go around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident was the nose landing gear swivel assembly failure, the lack of a hydraulic fuse before this critical failure point, and the design of the swivel using two similar alloys with a propensity to adhere to each other when rubbed together. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of a disciplined cockpit environment.""14-02-2011",Test,NTSB ,2011
16-FEB-2011,Cessna 525 CitationJet CJ1+,HB-VOV,Swiss Private Aviation,0,Grenchen Air...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20110216-0,Takeoff (TOF),Substantial,Brake problem Runway mishap,"A Cessna 525 Citation CJ1+ corporate jet plane, registered HB-VOV, sustained substantial damage in a takeoff accident at Grenchen Airport, Switzerland. The airplane operated on a flight from Grenchen Airport. Destination of the ferry flight was Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY) in England.The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) and the commander was pilot not flying (PNF).HB-VOV left stand ""white alpha"" at 0848 LT. The crew had previously received the necessary clearance to take off from runway 07 after a request to Grenchen aerodrome control (tower). The de-icing system was switched on from the outset in view of the prevailing conditions. The taxi checklist was completed on the short route to the runway 07 holding position via taxiway WHISKEY. This included, among other things, testing the functionality of the brakes, which was carried out by both crew members. No anomalies were found.At approximately the same time, the Grenchen aerodrome control air traffic control officer (ATCO) arranged for a runway inspection, as visibility did not allow a view from the tower to the end of runway 07. After receiving clearance at 0851 LT, the commander steered the aircraft onto runway 07 and initially turned west, in order to have the maximum runway length available for the subsequent takeoff (backtrack). After a further 180 degree clockwise turn, HB-VOV was positioned just north of the runway centerline, pointing to the east. To take advantage of the available runway length, the commander, according to his own statements, did not manoeuvre the aircraft precisely onto the runway centerline. Runway 07 has a takeoff run available (TORA) of 3281 ft (1000 m).The ATCO observed HB-VOV taxiing onto the runway and instructed the crew to hold on the runway, as a runway inspection was still in progress. In view of the expected delay, the commander then set the parking brake.At 085343 LT, the crew of HB-VOV received takeoff clearance ""Hotel Oscar Victor, wind zero six zero degrees six knots, runway zero seven, cleared for takeoff"".The commander then switched on the pitot heater and landing lights, pushed the thrust levers forward and handed control over to the copilot. He instructed the copilot, in view of the reduced visibility, to carry out a so-called standing takeoff.At a power setting with a low-pressure compressor speed N1 of approximately 90% of the rated speed the copilot took his feet off the brake pedals, set takeoff thrust and steered the aircraft on the runway centerline. The set takeoff thrust was checked by both crew members.The ATCO watched the HB-VOV takeoff roll and noticed slower acceleration than usual. After checking the takeoff thrust and the speed indications at the beginning of the takeoff roll, the commander had the impression that the aircraft's acceleration was lower than usual. HB-VOV attained a speed of 80 kt before taxiway ECHO 1, i.e. rather late, but still within a framework which seemed acceptable to the commander. On reaching rotation speed (VR), in the co-pilot's estimation approximately 250 m before the end of the runway, the commander called out ""rotate"", whereupon the copilot pulled on the control column. Both crew members immediately noticed that the nose of the aircraft was not lifting. After a repeated callout by the commander, he too pulled on the control column. On overshooting the end of the runway, the right main landing gear of HB-VOV struck a ""end-of-runway"" light, which was perceived by the crew as a distinctly noticeable impact. On the transition from the runway to the grass, the copilot, according to his statement, had the feeling that it was no longer possible to continue the takeoff and briefly reduced power. But at approximately the same time, the copilot noted that HB-VOV had already lifted off and applied full power again.At the same time, he asked the commander whether the takeoff process should continue. The latter answered the copilot's question in the affirmative, with the consideration that they would perhaps still have a chance to get the aircraft into the air. The events from overshooting the end of the runway to lift-off of HB-VOV, after a roll of more than 100 metres in the adjacent meadow, occurred within a few seconds. In the process the aircraft crossed a small stream bed running perpendicular to the runway.Once the aircraft had attained the normal attitude for a climb at the appropriate takeoff safety speed V2, the commander reduced power to maximum continuous thrust (MCT) and retracted the flaps. Then the crew realised that the parking brake was still set. The commander retracted the landing gear and detected that the red warning light did not go out. He instructed the copilot to keep the speed low and extended the gear again. All three landing gear indicators indicated green. At an altitude of approximately 3500 ft AMSL, HB-VOV was transferred to Berne arrival air traffic control. As part of the climb check, the de-icing system was switched off again.The crew subsequently decided to make an alternate landing at Zurich airport.The crew did not declare an emergency and did not apply for landing priority. According to the landing gear indicators in the cockpit, the crew assumed that the landing gear was extended and locked. For this reason they did not make a low pass at Zurich airport for an external visual check of the landing gear.After the approach and landing, HB-VOV exited runway 14 at the end via taxiway HOTEL 3. The crew then waived a visual check and taxied the aircraft directly to the stand on the apron near the General Aviation Centre (GAC).As a result of the collision of the right main landing gear of HB-VOV with the endof-runway light and the subsequent crossing of the stream bed, structural damage was found in the area of the nose gear and main gear, as well as to both rear wing spars. Also, a certain asymmetry was ascertained in the dimensions of the aircraft.The two pilots were uninjured in the accident.CAUSESThe accident is attributable to a collision with obstacles beyond the end of the runway, because the aircraft did not achieve the expected acceleration during the take-off roll and because the take-off roll was nevertheless continued.The following causal factors were identified- reduced acceleration of the aircraft during take-off because of the set parking brake.- the missing decision of the crew to respond to the reduced acceleration by aborting the take-off.The fact that the aircraft had no warning device to indicate a set parking brake when the take-off roll is initiated contributed to the accident.",Ferry/positioning,SUST Switzerland ,2011

Thus, it can be said that the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) of the PR-TTI left main gear broke on account of fatigue, whose onset was facilitated by an inadequate machining process that had been performed in the section transition region of the pin.3 Material FactorNot a contributor.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CENIPA ,2011

None of the eleven occupants were injured.The airplane operated on scheduled flight M3990 from OLA (Ørland) to OSL. During roll-out following a normal landing, when the aircraft's speed had decreased to less than 60 kt, the aircraft started an uncommanded turn to the right. The nose wheel steering system was activated. The course could not be corrected, and the aircraft veered off the side of the runway where it became stuck in hard-packed snow one meter deep.The investigation has shown that the loss of control was most likely caused by a fault in the nose wheel steering. The same problem had occurred six days earlier, but the commander then managed to disconnect the nose wheel steering in time and regained control. The fault could not be reproduced, and the aircraft was released to service after inspection and testing without remarks.The nose wheel steering system on this aircraft type is relatively complex, and over time several improvements have been made to improve its reliability. The Flight Manual has a caution related to activation of nose wheel steering at speeds higher than normal taxi speed.There was some freezing rain/freezing fog at the time of the accident.Comprehensive technical examination of the nose wheel steering on OY-NPB uncovered no single causal factor, but some indications of unsatisfactory maintenance. Irregularities that alone or in combination could have caused a temporary fault with the steering were present. The Accident Investigation Board believes that a temporary fault caused the nose wheel to unintentionally lock itself in a position towards the right. No other defects or irregularities that could explain why the aircraft veered off the runway were found.02-03-201102-03-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AIBN ,2011

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured. The pilot reported that following two attempts to land in crosswind conditions, he was cleared to land and was instructed by the air traffic control tower controller to follow another airplane on final approach. For spacing considerations, the controller instructed the pilot to conduct ""S"" turns behind the traffic landing ahead of him. As the airplane descended to an altitude of about 200 feet above ground level, the controller instructed the pilot to go around and maintain altitude. The pilot executed a go-around procedure, which included retracting the landing gear and reducing the flap setting to one-half flaps. Shortly after, the pilot was issued a clearance to land. The pilot proceeded with the landing clearance and subsequently landed with the gear in the retracted position, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe.

There were no injuries, and aircraft damage was limited to the nose and main landing gear, which was subsequently replaced.The flight departed Long Beach, CA (LGB) en route to Milan, Italy, with a planned fuel stop in Iqaluit (YFB), Canada. The flight time to Iqaluit was 5 hours and 36 minutes at a cruise altitude of 41 000 feet. The flight en route was uneventful; the outside temperature at the cruising altitude was approximately -60°C.The first officer was the pilot flying. An ILS/DME approach to runway 35 at Iqaluit was carried out with the autopilot on. The reported surface winds were within the aircraft limitations for a right crosswind with a light tailwind component. A reference speed (VREF) of 114 knots was calculated. The before-landing checklist items were completed 3 miles prior to the final approach fix. The autopilot was disconnected, and the aircraft crossed the threshold at a speed of about 118 knots.The aircraft touched down approximately 10 feet to the right of the centreline at 2100. Once the nose wheel contacted the runway, the aircraft veered to the right. The crew applied full left rudder and left brake while selecting left nose steering with the tiller. Thrust reversers were also selected, but the aircraft continued to pull to the right. The aircraft departed the runway 4300 feet from the threshold and came to rest in packed snow 100 feet from the runway edge lights.

The captain was the pilot flying and the takeoff, climb and cruise portion of the flight was uneventful. Prior to landing, the captain conducted the approach briefing, indicating that they would conduct a visual approach to runway 26, the gusty winds required a wind additive to the approach speed and would go-around if the approach was not stabilized.On final approach, the local controller cleared the flight to land and reported the winds were 310 degrees at 16 knots. The flight crew stated that at 1000 feet AGL the landing checklist was complete, the airplane was fully configured for landing and the approach speed was set to 132 knots (Vref + 5). Recorder data indicated that during the final approach, the autothrottle was disconnected about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed decreased to as low as 129 knots but did not go below Vref (127 knots). The first officer (FO) stated that he called out the low airspeed and adjusted the target airspeed from 132 to 134 knots. The captain increased power during the approach but the airspeed remained slightly below Vapp until landing. Pitch attitude on final approach was stable at about 5 to 6 degrees nose up. The pitch attitude at touchdown was about 7 degrees and the airplane touched down first on the right main landing gear (MLG) and then on the left MLG. The flight crew stated that they felt that the airplane bounced and both called for a go around simultaneously.

One of the three crew members was killed.The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 1503 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon. At about 1814 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft.The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications.At 1817 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon. By 1818, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 1825, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss.By 1827, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27.Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations.At about 1828, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl). Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered.The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight. The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence.Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons.FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS1. The right engine lost power when the intermediate spur gear on the torque sensor shaft failed. This resulted in loss of drive to the high-pressure engine-driven pump, fuel starvation, and immediate engine stoppage.2. The ability of the left-hand No. 2 ejector pump to deliver fuel to the collector tank was compromised by foreign object debris (FOD) in the ejector pump nozzle.3. When the fuel level in the left collector tank decreased, the left fuel level warning light likely illuminated but was not noticed by the crew.4. The pilots did not execute the fuel level warning checklist because they did not perceive the illumination of the fuel level left tank warning light. Consequently, the fuel crossfeed valve remained closed and fuel from only the left wing was being supplied to the left engine.5. The left engine flamed out as a result of depletion of the collector tank and fuel starvation, and the crew had to make a forced landing resulting in an impact with a concrete noise abatement wall.01-04-201101-04-201101-04-201101-04-201101-04-2011",Survey/research,TSB Canada ,2011
02-APR-2011,Gulfstream G650,N652GD,Gulfstream Aerospace,4,Roswell Inte...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20110402-0,Takeoff (TOF),Destroyed,Loss of control,"A Gulfstream G650 jet was damaged beyond repair in a takeoff accident at Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW). The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured.The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior.The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred.The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted.During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated.Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds.Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the cause of this accident was an aerodynamic stall and subsequent uncommanded roll during a one engine-inoperative takeoff flight test, which were the result of (1) Gulfstream's failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds for the flight tests and recognize and correct the takeoff safety speed (V2) error during previous G650 flight tests, (2) the G650 flight test team's persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve V2 speeds that were erroneously low, and (3) Gulfstream's inadequate investigation of previous G650 uncommanded roll events, which indicated that the company's estimated stall angle of attack while the airplane was in ground effect was too high. Contributing to the accident was Gulfstream's failure to effectively manage the G650 flight test program by pursuing an aggressive program schedule without ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of team members had been appropriately defined and implemented, engineering processes had received sufficient technical planning and oversight, potential hazards had been fully identified, and appropriate risk controls had been implemented and were functioning as intended.""02-04-201102-04-201102-04-201102-04-201102-04-201102-04-201102-04-2011",Test,NTSB ,2011

The airplane carried 29 passengers and four crew members. One passenger survived the accident.The airplane operated on behalf of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on flight UNO834, a round trip from Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH) to Kisangani (FKI). The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 1218. The pilot in command was the pilot flying on this leg.At 1331, the crew reported to Kinshasa Approach that they were over position GURUT (137 NM from Kinshasa), gave their Expected Time of Arrival Kinshasa as 1355 and received the latest Kinshasa weather information. At the time, Kinshasa weather being reported was wind 340 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 10 km, scattered clouds at 2500 feet, Charlie Bravos (CBs) at 3000 feet, CBs in the North East and South East, Temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1009, trend NOSIG.At 1339, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield.At 1349, when the aircraft was about 32 NMs from Kinshasa VOR/DME, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting ""wind 210 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 8 KM, thunderstorm over the station, scattered cloud at 2500 feet, few Charlie Bravo 3000 feet, Charlie Bravo located north-east, south west and west, broken 12000 feet, temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1008, trend NOSIG"". The co-pilot replied to ATC that weather was copied and read back the QNH.At 1350, UNO 854 was cleared for a straight-in Localizer approach for runway 24. The crew discussed options of avoiding the severe weather being displayed on their on-board weather radar by skirting around the radar returns. The aircraft approached the airfield at high speed. The indicated air speed came below 250 knots at 1353 when the aircraft was descending through an altitude of 4630 feet and was 13 NM from threshold runway 24.While intercepting the Localizer for runway 24, the aircraft remained to the south (left) of the Localizer path. During the execution of the Localizer Approach, the crew made a more than 15 degree heading change to fly even further away from the Localizer path when the aircraft was between 10-7 NM from runway 24.As the aircraft came close to the airfield, the co-pilot sighted the runway on his right one o'clock position, when the aircraft was about 9.7 nautical miles from displaced threshold of runway 24. The PIC too, sighted the runway when the aircraft was about 6.4 NM away from threshold. At that stage, the aircraft speed was 210 knots, altitude was 3250 feet (or about 2252 feet above ground level) and the aircraft was in clean configuration. The crew decided to continue their Approach. The captain disengaged the autopilot, turned towards the runway and gave instructions to co-pilot to configure the aircraft for landing. The crew managed to regain Localizer path and align the aircraft to the runway by the time they were 2 NM from the threshold.At around this time, Kinshasa airfield was affected by a squall line. As the aircraft came on short finals, it encountered rain. By this stage, the aircraft was below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for Localizer Approach for runway 24. MDA for Localizer Approach for Runway 24 is 1470 feet or 472 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The crew switched on wind shield wipers. As they descended further to about 224 feet AGL and runway was not in sight, the crew decided to carry out a go around. During the process of go around, a positive rate of climb was established with appropriate airspeed.While climbing through an altitude of 1395 feet (or 397 feet AGL); the aircraft encountered a severe weather phenomenon (probably a microburst). The wind shear warning came on. The aircraft pitched significantly nose down (from about 4-5 degrees nose up attitude to 7 degrees nose down attitude) in a very short period of time. The aircraft rapidly lost height. Before the crew could react to the pitch down and recover from the steep descent, the aircraft impacted the terrain. The airplane broke up and the main wreckage came to rest upside down.Probable cause of the AccidentThe most probable cause of the accident was the aircraft's encounter with a severe Microburst like weather phenomenon at a very low altitude during the process of Go Around. The severe verticalgust/downdraft caused a significant and sudden pitch change to the aircraft which resulted in a considerable loss of height. Being at very low altitude, recovery from such a disturbance was not possible.The possibility of a somatogravic illusion caused Loss Of Control (LOC) as the primary cause of the accident, was also discussed by the investigation team. This was ruled out based on available evidence which showed that during the Go Around, the crew had initiated the climb at 1256 32 and had thereafter, maintained a climbing attitude for the next 12 seconds. At 1256 44, the aircraft experienced a sudden and steep nose down attitude change without a corresponding control input by the crew (as shown by FDR), Hence, Somatogravic Illusion caused Loss of Control was ruled out as a cause of accident.Probable contributing factors1. The inappropriate decision of the crew to continue the approach, in face of extremely inclement weather being displayed on their weather radar, was probably the principle contributing factor responsible for the accident.2. Lack of adequate supervision by the Operator to ensure that its crew complied with established procedures including weather avoidance procedures and Stabilized Approach criteria, was a probable contributing factor.3. Inadequacy of Georgian Airways Training program for upgrade to Captain was a probable contributing Factor.4. Lack of effective oversight of Georgian Airways by Georgian CAA was a probable contributing factor.5. Lack of appropriate equipment at Kinshasa airport for identification and tracking of adverse weather phenomenon, resulting in failure by ATC to provide appropriate early warning to the aircraft, was probably a contributing factor.6. ATC not declaring the airfield closed when visibility dropped below Minima was a probable contributory factor.04-04-2011",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,IAAI DRC ,2011

The air traffic controller asked AC881 to maintain the position due to two pushbacks in the area. After the departure of a first aircraft, the controller authorized the crew of Oman Air flight 134 to do a long push back from stand A8 to position themselves facing west in order to then push back AC881 in front of them.After push back AC881 was not fully aligned with taxiway P. The pushback tractor driver pulled the aircraft in reverse to put it back in line with the track; first to the right of the aircraft, then to the left. The aircraft speed increased for about 15 secondsto reach 4 kt.During this manoeuvre, the B777 approaches the tractor. The tractor driver brakes. The angle between the tow bar and the aircraft axis increases. The train front begins to turn to the left, then the safety pins on the head of the coupling break. The aircraft continued to advance, the rudder pivoted and jammed under the left front wheel tyre and comes into contact with the tractor. It breaks down and the plane disengages from the tractor. The aircraft then continued to advance on the tractor.At 094445, the part of the bar still connected to the nose gear contacted the tractor and causes an additional rotation of the front axle.

There were no injuries among the 202 passengers and 13 crew members.Flight 470 took off from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) at 0855 UTC on a regular service to Caracas, Venezuela. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Weather at the destination was poor due to the presence of several thunderstorms and rain. The captain was pilot flying during the ILS approach to runway 10 at Caracas.The airplane was aligned with the localizer at 10 NM from the threshold and the glideslope was intercepted at 6 NM. The crew selected a Vapp approach speed of 136 kts and moments later disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. Passing 1000 feet above aerodrome level the crew was able to observe the runway. Descent rate at the time was -950 feet per minute and the airplane had rolled 3° to the right at an airspeed of 153 kt (Vapp + 17 kt). Shortly before passing 500 feet the captain had to correct some deviations, causing roll angles reaching 9°. At 200 feet the airplane was above the glide path and the pilot monitoring reported that the airspeed increased from 138 kt to 153 kt. The airspeed decreased again to below 136 kts with the GPWS warning ""Sink Rate!"" at 35 feet.The airplane touched down at 2,74 G with a descent rate of -1200 ft/min.Flight 470 taxied to the terminal without any problems. The captain reported the hard landing in the Aircraft Technical Log and reported it to the station manager at Caracas. One Air France technician performed a walk around check in very heavy rain and low light conditions. The Aircraft Condition Monitoring System (ACMS) did not generate an automated 'hard landing' report, and no report was received at the company's Maintenance Control Center (MCC). The Data Management Unit (DMU), part of the ACMS was checked and it was concluded that there was no defect. Consequently, the airplane was released for the return flight to Paris.Upon takeoff from Caracas at 1830 local time, the crew were not able to raise the undercarriage. Several alarms related to cabin conditioning were triggered and displayed on the ECAM. After burning off fuel the crew landed safely back at Caracas. After parking, significant damage was found on the right hand main landing gear and fuselage structure.CausesThe hard landing is due to the continuation of the landing while the flight path changes should have lead to a go-around. The workload generated by flying without the assistance of A/THR, in degraded weather conditions is a contributing factor.The hard landing caused the implosion of the fixed piston of the damper of the right hand landing gear, which was not detectable on the ground at the stopover. This made it impossible to retract the landing gear during the return flight.The use of inadequate technical notes, the operator into force the day of the event and the lack of issuance of report R15 did not detect the damage caused by the hard landing. This has led to the departure of a commercial flight with a badly damaged aircraft.",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2011

Bird International Airport (ANU), the aircraft made an approach to runway 10 at John A. Osborne Airport, Montserrat. After a normal touchdown the pilot applied the brakes and noticed that there was no resistance from the right brake pedal. While maintaining directional control with the rudder pedals the pilot tried to ""pump"" the brake pedals but this had no effect on the right brakes. To avoid departing the end of the runway the pilot applied left brake and allowed the aircraft to veer left onto the grass just beyond the taxiway exit. The aircraft struck an embankment located 20 m north of the runway edge, about 150 m from the end of the runway. The impact, which was estimated by the pilot to be at about 10 kt, resulted in damage to the nose structure and caused the nose landing gear leg to collapse. The left wing tip leading edge was also damaged when it struck the embankment.After the aircraft came to rest the passengers were able to exit the aircraft via the main doorThe probable cause for the loss of right braking was trapped air in the right brake hydraulic lines. This air may have been present prior to the O-ring seal removal but was more likely to have been introduced during the seal removal and replacement. The engineer had carried out a brake bleeding procedure but he had not completed the full procedure as described in the AMM. He had not opened the bleed screw at the top of the right landing gear leg, and therefore air may have remained trapped in these lines. The investigation revealed the existence of several different brake bleeding procedures. The aircraft manufacturer had three different brake bleeding procedures, namely the Islander AMM procedure, the Trislander AMM procedure and their own production procedure. Three engineers from three different maintenance organisations had suggested that sometimes the manufacturers procedures were inadequate for completely bleeding all the air out and that a hand pump attached to the brake bleed screws was sometimes required.16-04-2011",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2011

The airspeed was 152 knots and the vertical speed was 830 feet/min. During the flare the pilot flying started to correct the rate of decent by increasing the pitch attitude. At touchdown the pitch attitude was 4.6°, the computed airspeed was 143 knots, the vertical speed was 160 feet/min. The aircraft touched down and bounced three times. After the first bounce, the ground spoilers automatically retracted and the auto braking system disarmed. A second bounce occurred followed by a third bounce. After the third bounce, the speed brakes handle was pulled either by the pilot flying or by thrust reverser command, which deployed the ground spoilers and the thrust reversers. The reversers were deployed in 11 seconds. During the deceleration, the pitch angle gradually increased to 10.5° and the aircraft suffered a tailstrike. At the same time the pilot flying felt an increasing pitch up attitude and decided to initiate a go-around. An initiation of a GA after thrust reverser activation is very risky and not an option according to the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM).After the ground spoilers were retracted and the reversers were stowed, the pitch angle was decreased to 7.0°. At that time, the indicated airspeed was 117 knots. Engine power was applied and as the airspeed increased. The increase of the forward engine thrust caused a further nose up pitch moment, resulting in an increasing pitch angle of 11.9°.During lift off the indicated airspeed (IAS) was 140 knots, which was 8 knots below the V2 calculated speed. The lower speed gave less lift and kept the main landing gear compressed. The result was less aft tail belly clearance, leading the second tail strike. During initial climb, the flight crew noticed a beeper aural warning and the tailstrike caution on the upper Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display. The flight crew performed a tail strike Malfunction Check List and a Go Around Check List. The pilot not flying informed ATC about the go around and the tailstrike indication and that the pilots didn't have control problems with the aircraft. A new approach was requested to runway 22L.The aircraft landed without further problems.CONCLUSIONSAfter the third bounce and at touch down, the PF didnt prevent the pitch angle to increase. The lack of forward elevator control input caused the first tail strike. During the GA, the aircraft was rotated to a pitch angle of 10.2° which caused the second tail strike. The tail strike was prolonged as the pitch angle increased to 11.9° with a V2 speed minus 8 knots, which prolonged the time with a compressed main landing gear and less aft tail clearance.17-04-2011",Cargo,HCLJ Denmark ,2011

The airplane was operated by the North Slope Borough, Barrow, Alaska, as a instrument flight rules (IFR), public aircraft medical transport positioning flight. The airline transport pilot received minor injuries, and the two North Slope Borough medical personnel aboard received minor injuries. During the approach to Atqasuk, the airplane accumulated a large quantity of airframe ice, and the pilot decided to discontinue the approach. He then retracted the landing gear, but the airplane failed to climb as anticipated, and struck the ground.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot did not maintain sufficient airspeed during an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control.

The pilot survived the accident.The airplane was operating from a temporary airstrip for crop spraying flights in the area. The flights were conducted without meteorological support and without radio contact. The person who flew the airplane did not have a valid pilots license. During one of the spraying runs the engine lost power. To avoid a collision with trees, the pilot carried out a forced landing in plowed field. The airplane nosed in after a 32 m ground run and flipped over. The engine caught fire.CONCLUSIONThe accident to aircraft An-2 RA-68122 occurred when the aircraft nosed down while performing a landing on a plowed field, due, probably, to an engine failure.Determining the cause of failure was not possible because fragments of the aircraft and engine were evacuated from the scene of the accident and disposed of before the arrival of the Commission of Inquiry.The flights performed were agricutural flights by a crew of one pilot who had no legitimate evidence of being a pilot.

The 19 passengers and three crew members on board did not survive the accident.The airplane operated on SOL Líneas Aéreas flight 5428 from Córdoba (COR) to Mendoza (MDZ), Neuquén (NQN) and Comodoro Rivadavia (CRD). The flight departed Neuquén at 2005 for the final leg of the flight. The aircraft climbed to FL190. After flying for 24 minutes, the pilot levelled the aircraft at 17800 ft, and remained at this level for approximately 9 minutes.When flying at FL179, the aircraft began to pick up ice. The copilot radioed air traffic control for permission to descent. The flight was then cleared down to FL140. However, while descending the crew members commented on the growing ice accretion on the wind shield and wings. By the time the aircraft had reached FL140, the icing conditions were severe. The aircraft flew for approximately two minutes with a straight and level flight attitude, increasing the accumulation of ice.The airspeed dropped until the airplane stalled. The pilots attempted to regain control of the plane, but failed. The airplane impacted terrain and burned.CauseDuring a commercial, domestic passenger flight, while cruising, the crew lost control of the aircraft, which uncontrollably impacted the ground due to severe ice formation caused by the following factors> Entering an area with icing conditions without adequately monitoring the warning signals from the external environment (temperature, cloudiness, precipitation and ice accumulation) or the internal (speed, angle of attack), which allowed for prolonged operations in icing conditions to take place.> Receiving a forecast for slight icing - given that the aircraft encountered sever icing conditions - which led to a lack of understanding regarding the specific meteorological danger.> Inadequately evaluating the risks, which led to mitigating measures such as adequate briefing (distribution of tasks in the cockpit, review of the de-icing systems, limitations, use of power, use of autopilot, diversion strategy etc.) not being adopted.> Levels of stress increasing, due to operations not having the expected effects, which led the crew to lose focus on other issues.> Icing conditions that surpassed the aircraft's ice protection systems, which were certified for the aircraft (FAR 25 Appendix C).> Inadequate use of speed, by maintaining the speed close to stall speed during flight in icing conditions.> Inadequate use of the autopilot, by not selecting the IAS mode when flying in icing conditions.> Partially carrying out the procedures established in the Flight Manual and the Operations Manual, when entering into areas with severe icing conditions.> Realizing late that the aircraft had started to stall, because the buffeting that foretells a stall was confused with the vibrations that signify ice contamination on the propellers.> Activation of the Stick Shaker and Stall Warning at a lower speed than expected in icing conditions.> Using a stall recovery technique which prioritized the reduction of the angle of attack at the expense of altitude loss, and which was inappropriate for the flight conditions.> The aileron flight controls reacting in an unusual manner when the aircraft lost control, probably due to the accumulation of ice in the surfaces of these, which made it impossible for the aircraft to recover.> The increasingly stressful situation of the crew, which affected its operational decision-making18-05-201125 APR 1985SE-E25Saab30 MAY 1985N344CAComairOCT 1996N344CAChicago Express AirlinesDEC 1996N344CAExpress Airlines IFEB 1997N112PXExpress Airlines IMAY 2002N112PXPinnacle Airlines17 JUL 2003N112PXFina AirJUL 2004N112PXFina Air25 MAY 2006N112PXRegionsAirMAR 2007N112PXRegionsAir30 JUL 2010LV-CEJSOL Líneas Aéreas",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,JIAAC Argentina ,2011

There were three crew members on board and all escaped unhurt. The flight crew indicated that they delayed their takeoff due to high wind conditions. Once the winds were within limits, they reported that startup was normal. Prior to takeoff, they decided to add 5 knots to their rotation speed, and power up slowly and as smoothly as possible.The captain was the flying pilot. The first officer called critical engine failure recognition speed (V1) reference speed at 141 knots, and rotation speed (Vr) at 150 knots. The captain rotated the airplane, and it then lifted off about 7,000 feet down the 11,000-foot runway. About 20 feet above ground level (agl), the number two engine (left inboard) throttle lever slammed back to the idle position. The No. 2 engine pylon had separated from the left wing. The No. 2 engine nacelle and pylon assembly struck the No. 1 engine nacelle, causing the No. 1 engine inlet cowl to separate, which degraded the engines ability to produce thrust and resulted in a significant loss of thrust on the left side of the airplane.The flight crew reported that the airplane began to drift to the left and descend. The captain lowered the pitch slightly and leveled the wings just prior to the airplane contacting the runway. He informed the other crew members that they were going to put it back down. He placed the throttle levers in the idle position, and activated the speed brakes. The airplane departed the left side of the runway surface; the crew reported a couple of impacts and then one final violent impact prior to the airplane coming to rest in a wetland marsh.The flight crew had to force the cockpit door open due to debris that had piled up against it. They noted significant damage from the forward galley aft, and a large fire in the vicinity of the left wing. They opened the left main cabin door, and deployed the slide. They exited into the mud, and made it to dry land and away from the burning wreckage.Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident site. The observed debris field extended 4,120 feet on a heading of 218 degrees. The first pieces of wreckage found along the debris path were fragments of the number two (left inboard) engine pylon; they were just past taxiway Alpha 2, about 7,500 feet from the beginning of runway 21. The number one engine (left outboard) nose cowl was about 450 feet further into the debris field and left of the runway surface in the grass infield.The number two engine nose cowl was near the runway arresting gear on the left side of the runway at the 8,500 foot point. The number two engine was about 230 feet further, and on the left side of the runway surface.The airplane departed the asphalt surface near taxiway Alpha 1, which was 9,500 feet from the departure end of the runway. Ground scars continued through the grass infield to taxiway Alpha at the end of the runway. The number one engine was in the grass infield near taxiway Alpha.The main wreckage came to rest in a wetland marsh left of the runway overrun, and caught fire. Fire consumed the top of the cabin and the cockpit. The main wreckage consisted of the cockpit, cabin, right wing with the number three (right inboard) engine partially attached, empennage, and the inboard half of the left wing, which sustained thermal damage and was under water. Scattered debris aft of the main wreckage included the nose gear, remnants of the burned outboard left wing, right main landing gear truck, and number four (right outboard) engine.A visual examination of a fracture surface on the number two engine pylon inboard mid-spar support fitting determined that it was flat and discolored with an arcing terminus.The aircraft was registered and operated by Omega Air Inc., an air refueling contractor that uses specially-equipped and converted civilian airplanes to serve as air refueling platforms for the military. The flight was conducted under the provisions of a contract between Omega and the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) to provide aerial refueling of Navy F/A-18s in offshore warning area airspace.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of a midspar fitting, which was susceptible to fatigue cracking and should have been replaced with a newer, more fatigue-resistant version of the fitting as required by an airworthiness directive. Also causal was an erroneous maintenance entry made by a previous aircraft owner, which incorrectly reflected that the newer fitting had been installed.""18-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-201118-05-2011",Military,NTSB ,2011

The captain, who was the flying pilot, and two of the three passengers were not injured. The first officer and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by JetSuite. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed. The flight originated from San Jose, California, about 1420 hours local time.Following an uneventful flight, the flight crew briefed the arrival to the destination airport and set the calculated landing speeds. The captain and the first officer reported that during final approach, it felt like the airplane was 'pushed up' as the wind shifted to a tailwind or updraft before landing near the runway number markings. Upon touchdown, the captain applied the brakes and thought that the initial braking was effective; however, he noticed the airplane was not slowing down. The captain applied maximum braking, and the airplane began to veer to the right; he was able to correct back to the runway centerline, but the airplane subsequently exited the departure end of the runway and traveled down a steep embankment. Recorded communication from the cockpit voice and data recorder (CVDR) revealed that during the approach to landing, the flight crew performed the landing checks, and the captain noted difficulty judging the approach. About 1 minute later, the recording revealed that the ground warning proximity system reported ""five hundred"" followed by a ""sink rate, pull up"" alert about 16 seconds later. Data from the CVDR revealed that about 23 seconds before weight-on-wheels was recorded, the airplane was at an indicated airspeed of about 124 knots and descending. The data showed that this approximate airspeed was maintained until about 3 seconds before weight-on-wheels. The recorded data further showed that the approach speed was set to 120 knots, and the landing reference speed (Vref) was set to 97 knots. Using the reported airplane configuration and the 3.5-knot headwind that was reported at the time of the approach and landing, calculations indicate that the Vref speed should have been about 101 knots indicated airspeed, which would have required a landing distance of about 3,112 feet. Utilizing the same airplane configuration and wind condition with the flights reported 124 knot indicated airspeed just before touchdown, the landing distance was calculated to be about 5,624 feet. The intended runway for landing was 5,132-feet long with a 1.9 percent downward slope gradient, and a 123-foot long overrun area.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilots unstabilized approach and excessive airspeed during approach, which resulted in an insufficient landing distance to stop the airplane before overrunning the runway.""25-05-201125-05-201125-05-201125-05-2011",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2011

He lowered the landing gear, and landed the airplane uneventfully. He elected to remain overnight at the airport due to fatigue. The next day, he decided to test fly the airplane. During the takeoff roll, the airplane had a severe vibration, and he aborted the takeoff. During a subsequent inspection, an aviation mechanic discovered that the center wing carry-through cracked when the belly skid pad deflected up into a stringer during the gear-up landing.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot landed without lowering the landing gear.

According to the flight crew, the airplane was flying in smooth IMC conditions at FL200, with an area of ""moderate to heavy to extreme"" precipitation located about 30 miles to the northwest. As the airplane approached 20 miles from the weather, it began to experience moderate turbulence and rime ice on the windscreen. The pilot flying deviated course 40-degrees to the south.

There was no fire, and the flight crew was not injured.At approximately 1500, the aircraft departed runway 05 at Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ) for a ferry flight to Buttonville. At 1503, the Toronto ACC controller cleared the aircraft for a contact approach to runway 33, to begin the descent, and to keep the approach tight, as there was traffic to follow. At that point, the aircraft was approximately 3 nm from the airport, descending through 2600 feet asl with a ground speed of 230 knots, and heading towards the threshold of runway 33 on a tight left base.Then the crew was instructed to switch to the Buttonville tower frequency. The Buttonville tower controller provided altimeter information and cleared the aircraft to land on Runway 33. At this time, the aircraft was descending through 1400 feet asl with a ground speed of 210 knots, and was located approximately 0.3 nm from the inbound track to runway 33. The aircraft levelled out from the right turn and was heading in an eastward direction. It flew through the inbound track at a transverse angle of about 120° at approximately 1 nm final. In an attempt to regain the runway centreline, the aircraft banked left, exceeding 30° of bank. The aircraft overflew the runway centreline by approximately 0.3 nm.At 1504, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) issued an aural alert to pull up. A missed approach was called by the FO in a low tone of voice and using non-standard phraseology. The captain responded, but continued the approach. Shortly afterwards, the GPWS sounded another aural alert to pull up.The aircraft was approximately 300 feet above ground level, 0.7 nm south of runway 33 and 0.3 nm east of the inbound track, in a left bank towards the runway threshold. The captain called for full flaps and banked the aircraft steeply to the right after regaining the runway centreline while on short final.The FO reminded the captain of the landing reference speed (Vref), 4 and twice called out Vref plus 5 knots.At 150449, the aircraft touched down hard on the main landing gear in a nose-high attitude, then immediately departed the runway surface to the right. The ground speed during the runway excursion could not be determined, but was estimated to be less than 110 knots. The captain applied the brakes and initially attempted to steer the aircraft onto the runway using the rudder. However, due to the infield's grass surface, braking and steering responses were minimal. Although the tiller was available for nose-wheel steering, it is not normally used until the speed is below 80 knots.The aircraft traversed the grass infield to the intersection of taxiways Charlie and Bravo, continued onto taxiway Bravo, and struck a runway/taxiway identification sign before crossing the intersection of taxiways Bravo and Alpha. The aircraft struck the sign with the right side of the nose section, the inboard leading edge and the right-wing slats. The sign was struck with sufficient force that it was torn away from its base and came to rest behind the aircraft on the apron. The aircraft came to a stop on the grass just beyond the intersection of taxiways Bravo and Bravo/Alpha.FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS1. The crew flew an unstabilized approach with excessive airspeed.2. The lack of adherence to company standard operating procedures and crew resource management, as well as the non-completion of checklist items by the flight crew contributed to the occurrence.3. The captains commitment to landing or lack of understanding of the degree of instability of the flight path likely influenced the decision not to follow the aural GPWS alerts and the missed approach call from the first officer.4.

Forty-seven occupants died in the accident; five survived.RusAir Flight 9605 had departed Moscow-Domodedovo (DME) at 2224 on a domestic service to Petrozavodsk. The flight was operated by RusAir on behalf of RusLine. Flight RLU-243 could not be operated by RusLine's Canadair Regional Jets because it lacked the seating capacity needed for the service between Domodedovo and Petrozavodsk.Therefor RusAir was chartered to operate the flight using a Tu-134. The Tupolev struck trees and crash-landed on a highway while on final approach to runway 01. It broke up and came to rest about 390 metres to the right of the runway's extended centreline and 570 m short of the runway threshold.CONCLUSIONThe airplane flew an approach in conditions worse than weather minimums for the airfield and the crew failed decide to go-around. Instead the airplane descended below the minimum safe altitude in the absence of visual contact with approaching lighting and landmarks, which led to contact with trees and the ground in controlled flight. Contributing factors were - Poor interaction of the crew and poor crew resource management (CRM) from the commander of the flight during the approach. The pilot subordinated himself to the navigator causing the co-pilot to be effectively excluded from decisions. - The use during the flight of a navigator in a light level of alcoholic intoxication- Incorrect weather forecast with regards to height of the cloud base, visibility and severe weather - fog. - The use of navigation equipment that used satellite navigation to determine the aircrafts position, which was in violation of the Flight Manual Supplement for the Tu-134.20-06-201120-06-201120-06-201120-06-201120-06-201120-06-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2011

There were eight passengers on board and one pilot. One passenger was killed in the accident.During the takeoff run on runway 33, the aircraft's airspeed indicator initially rose as the aircraft accelerated and its nose wheel lifted off the runway. The flaps were set to 20° and the engine produced rated power. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft encountered several soft spots near the taxiway intersection. The pilot applied rearward pressure on the control yoke and one or both main wheels briefly lifted off the runway, but the airspeed stopped increasing and the aircraft did not remain airborne. The pilot rejected the takeoff with an estimated 600 feet of runway remaining. The pilot selected engine power to idle, reverse propeller thrust, and flaps to 0° to maximize braking traction. The aircraft continued past the end of runway 33. The aircraft was travelling at a relatively low speed but the pilot was unable to stop before the aircraft dropped off the steep slope and proceeded down an embankment before coming to rest in a ravine. As a result of the impact, the aircraft was damaged and its fuel system was compromised. A post-crash fire ensued. The airplane was owned by Beaver Air Service, which flies under the name Missinippi Airways.Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors1. Runway conditions, the pilot's takeoff technique, and possible shifting wind conditions combined to reduce the rate of the aircraft's acceleration during the takeoff roll and prevented it from attaining takeoff airspeed.2. The pilot rejected the takeoff past the point from which a successful rejected takeoff could be completed within the available stopping distance.3. The steep drop-off and sharp slope reversal at the end of Runway 33 contributed to the occupant injuries and fuel system damage that in turn caused the fire. This complicated passenger evacuation and prevented the rescue of the injured passenger.4. The deceased passenger was not wearing the available shoulder harness. This contributed to the serious injuries received as a result of the impact when the aircraft reached the bottom of the ravine and ultimately to his death in the post-impact fire.04-07-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2011

11-JUL-2011,Antonov An-24RV,RA-47302,Angara Airlines,7,near Strezhevoy,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20110711-0,Landing (LDG),Damaged beyond repair,Engine fire Ditching,"An Antonov An-24RV passenger plane, registration RA-47302, crashed into the Ob River, Russia, killing seven passengers.Angara Airlines flight 5007 took off from Tomsk Airport at 1010 local time, bound for Surgut. One hour and 26 minutes into the flight, when flying at a cruising altitude of 6000 m, the left engine's ""chips in oil"" light activated.The engine parameters remained normal and the crew continued the flight. At 1044, the captain, sensing the smell of burning in the cockpit, informed the crew about this and decided to proceed to the alternate airfield Nizhnevartovsk. The flight was cleared to descend to 4,800 m and the left engine was put in flight idle mode. During the descent, the oil pressure in the left engine began to decrease to 3.5 kg/cm2, which was the minimum for the engine to operate.At 1049, the flight reached 4,800 m and the crew received further clearance to descend to 1,800 m and to fly a direct course to Nizhnevartovsk. At 1052, at an altitude of 3,600 m and a distance of 77 km from Nizhnevartovsk, the left engine ""dangerous vibration"" light illuminated  At the command of the captain, the flight engineer turned off the left engine with feathering of the propellerVisually convinced of the feathering of the left engine propeller, the captain saw flames from the engine compartment. At the same time, the fire alarm and the first stage of fire extinguishing went off. At the command of the captain, the flight engineer turned off the booster pumps and closed the stop valve of the left engine. The fire continued. At 1053, at a distance of 63 km from Nizhnevartovsk, the crew reported the fire to the controller. The engineer activated the second stage of firefighting but the fire was not extinguished. The captain then decided to make an emergency descent and landing on the Ob River, which he saw in a break in the clouds. Before landing, the flight mechanic turned off the right engine and feathered the propeller. At the moment of ditching, at a speed of 240 km / h, there was a separation of the left-hand propeller and gear box. The aircraft then encountered an underwater obstacle and the lower part of the fuselage collapsed, The tail section then separated and the passenger cabin was partially flooded with water. The evacuation of passengers took place through the emergency hatch in the cockpit, as well as through the resulting break in the aft fuselage. Seven passengers were killed. Ten passengers received various injuries.The aircraft accident involving An-24RV RA-47302 occurred during a ditching, which was performed because of a fire in the left AI-24-2 engine nacelle series number N49312005. Destruction of the aircraft with the loss of life was due to the collision of aircraft and underwater obstacles, which the crew could not anticipate and prevent. The occurrence of the fire most likely was caused by depressurization system venting left engine failure due to the centrifugal breather CA-24 number G872VT9 with subsequent release air-oil emulsion in the engine compartment of the engine, as well as delayed engine shutdown when the crew received a warning of ""shavings in the engine oil"", pressure fluctuations of the left engine within ±5 kg/cm2, a burning smell and the oil pressure dropping below the limit. Failure to inform the crew about the excessive vibration of the engine was due to the deterioration of the vibration measurement system, IV-41AM, most likely due to the changes (fluctuations) of the engine rotor speed in the process of the destruction of the bearing of the compressor rotor rear support and (or) misalignment of the IV-41AM-system which might have affected the decision of the crew to turn off the engine.The cause of the destruction of the Rotary pointer LP-24 # G872VT9 was the destruction of the impeller due to prolonged exposure to air/oil emulsions with high compressor rotor temperature, due to the destruction of the ball bearing rear bearings.Significant secondary damage to parts of the compressor rotor rear support site did not clearly establish the cause of the destruction of the bearing. Most likely, the destruction happened during its work with high misalignment of the rings.Increased misalignment of the rings could be- as a result of adverse addition available to the mating parts back support assembly of the compressor rotor beats (within TU) with the beat bearing obtained because of his irregular installation at an average (according to technical condition) engine repairs in JSC ""Aramilsky ARP""; - due to deviations from TU geometry of mating parts back support assembly of the compressor rotor. Contributing factors of the accident, most likely, were - the psychological unpreparedness of the pilot in command to turn off the engine in flight due to lack of experience of actual flight with one engine inoperative; - late detection of a fire by the crew and, as a consequence, failure to take timely measures to extinguish the fire. Due to lack of objective information to determine the cause of the late detection of a fire by the crew, a full assessment of the performance of all elements of the fire alarm system MTP-MTP-2A and 7, could not be made.11-07-201111-07-201111-07-201111-07-201111-07-201111-07-201111-07-201111-07-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2011

The two pilots on board were not injured.The aircraft had departed from North bound left (NL) water runway of Male International Airport (MLE) at 0820 local time for a routine training flight bound to Biyaadhoo Lagoon, the designated training area. The sky was clear with good visibility and wind 8-10 knots from west and south west.During the training five landings and takeoffs were made simulating different conditions of flight. All these landings and takeoffs were made inside the lagoon except the last landing where the crew decided to land on open water outside the lagoon. The crew were simulating a tail wind/single engine landing. As per the crew, the aircraft initial touch down was smooth. However, they stroke a wave which made the aircraft bounce foe about 20 feet. With the low power aircraft hit the water again with great impact, resulting multiple float attachments to break.

All 14 passengers and two crew members were killed. The airplane operated on NOAR Linhas Aéreas Flight 4896 from Recife (REC) to Mossoró (MVF) with an en route stop at Natal (NAT). The airplane had taken off from runway 18 at Recife at 0651. During the takeoff briefing, the captain said that he would consider the possibility of landing on the runway, if a failure occurred after V1 (decision speed), with sufficient runway and the landing gear still not retracted.He also said that, if a failure occurred after V1 and with the landing gear retracted, he would proceed with the flight, while the copilot would be in charge of monitoring the instruments and complementing the emergency procedures after 400ft AGL. He informed that, in such case, the turns would be made towards the ""good engine"" side.During the takeoff, three seconds after the captain requested retraction of the landing gear, a sound was heard from the engines.Despite the captain's request to retract the landing gear, his request was only complied with 50 seconds later, after the fourth time he repeated it.After verifying the engine failure occurrence, the copilot asked the captain to ""abort takeoff"" three times, adding that the aircraft had lost power. The captain proceeded with the departure, saying that there was not enough space to abort takeoff.The captain, then, told the copilot to request landing on runway ""thirty"", repeating this request twice, without taking into account that Recife Airport runway has the thresholds 18 and 36. The copilot, however, informed the Tower controller that the aircraft would proceed for a landing on runway 36.Shortly after this message, the copilot asked the captain to ""lower the aircraft nose"". In his reply, the captain asked the copilot to take it easy, and the copilot agreed ""I know, we are at 400ft, let's fly!"".Then, there was a significant change in the cockpit background noise, with the captain telling the copilot to feather the propellers of engine number 1.The captain told the copilot to call the Tower, and the copilot asked what his message to ATC should be. The captain instructed him to tell ATC that they were in emergency.The copilot's answer to the captain was ""We are in emergency. We are cleared to land on runway 36, let's go"".Then, the alerts ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" and ""Too low, terrain"" were heard several times.At 065245, the captain asked the copilot to feather the left engine propeller blades, and the copilot answered by saying that the propeller blades had already been feathered.At 065252, the copilot asked the captain to turn towards the aerodrome. The captain answered that he was already doing so. Shortly after, at 065302, the stall alert went off.The copilot then said ""eighty-one, lower the nose"", and then the alerts ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" and ""Too low, terrain!"" were heard.At 065322, the copilot uttered ""one hundred twenty feet"" and then a stall alert was heard.The copilot asked the captain to 'hold the power', and the captain said that 'it was in full power'.Then, the copilot asked the captain not to hold the nose too much to keep the aircraft from stalling.He then asked the captain whether they would land on the beach, and received a firm ""no"" as an answer.At 065343, the copilot commented to the captain that they were at a hundred twenty feet, and that there was not sufficient height to proceed to the runway, suggesting that they should land on a sand strip on the beach.The captain replied that he would not land on the beach, and informed that they would land in the ""field"", instead.At 065356, the copilot radioed ""NOAR 4-8-9-6 is... it is going to make an emergency landing on the beach...it is not possible to reach the runway... land here in the sand... land in the sand that does not"".Then, the stall alert went off.The captain, anew, told the copilot that they would not land in the sand, and the copilot replied that they would fall on top of the buildings. From this moment on, the stall alert continued being heard for 19 seconds up to the time the stall occurred, occasionally intercalated with the alerts ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" and ""Too low, terrain!""At 065412, the copilot asked the PIC to ""please"" land on the beach, to which the captain rudely answered that he would not do that.The copilot insisted, saying that they were not able to reach the runway, and the PIC said ""It's OK! Leave it to me!""At 065425, the copilot made a comment to the captain that they were stalling and repeated the comment.The nose was pitching up until the aircraft stalled, impacting a field close to a road. A fire erupted. The airplane came down in a vacant lot near the beach, located 1700 m from the runway threshold.Contributing factors1. Human Factor1.1 Medical aspecta) Anxiety - undeterminedThe perception of the danger, especially on the part of the copilot, affected the communication, and may have inhibited a more assertive posture, which might have led to an emergency landing on the beach and minimize the consequences of the accident.1.2 Psychological aspect1.2.1 Individual informationa) Attitude - undeterminedThe operational actions taken in face of the emergency may have resulted from the high level of the PICs self-confidence obtained in his years of experience in aviation, as well as from his resistance to accept opinions that were different from his own.b) Emotional state - undeterminedFrom the CVR data, it is possible to observe an accentuated level of anxiety and tension in face of the abnormal situation. These components may have influenced the judgment of the conditions affecting the operation of the aircraft.c) Decision making process - a contributorThe PICs insistence on proceeding to runway 36 after the onset of the emergency, even after the copilots realization that they were no longer able to reach the aerodrome, reflects an inappropriate judgment of the operational information presented.d) Stress evidence - undeterminedThe unexpected emergency situation during the takeoff and the lack of preparedness to deal with it may have generated a level of stress in the crew, affecting their operational response.1.2.2 Psychosocial informationa) Interpersonal relationship - undeterminedThe history of divergences involving the two pilots possibly hindered the exchange of information between them, creating a barrier for dealing with the adverse situation.b) Team dynamics - a contributorThe presence of diverging ideas in relation to the actions to be taken and the way they were treated, revealed cockpit integration and coordination problems that made it difficult to choose the best option for a safe landing when the aircraft could no longer reachthe aerodrome.c) Work-group culture - undeterminedThe company was informally divided into two groups, whose interaction was difficult. It is possible that this interaction difficulty was reflected in cabin management during the emergency, since this flight had a crewmember from each group.1.2.3 Organizational informationa) Training - a contributorThe failures that occurred in the companys training process affected the performance of the crew, since they did not have a conditioned behavior regarding the adoption of safe actions in response to the emergency.b) Organizational culture - a contributorThe actions taken by the company indicate informalities that resulted in incomplete operational training and in acts that compromised safety.1.3 Operational aspect1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircrafta) Application of flight controls - a contributorAccording to the FDR data, the pedal was not applied in a way that would allow a deflection of the rudder sufficient to maintain the coordination of the aircraft from a certain moment of the flight with asymmetric power.The drift values obtained on account of the inadequate application of the pedal penalized the aircraft performance, rendering it impossible to maintain a climb gradient or even a leveled flight.In the final phase of the flight, even with the decrease of the speed to values below the VMCA, in the midst of the continuous sound of the stall alert and repeated requests by the copilot to not ""hold the nose so as not to stall"", the PIC continued actuating in the pitch control until the aircraft reached a longitudinal attitude of 18° and stalled.b) Cockpit coordination - a contributorThe delay in retracting the landing gear after the first request made by the PIC, the command of the PIC to feather the propeller blades when they had already been feathered, and the request made by the copilot asking the PIC to turn towards the airport when the aircraft was already turning, were indications that the flow of tasks in the cockpit was not well coordinated.The emergency procedures prescribed in the checklist were not complied with. In the final moments of the flight, there was not agreement between the pilots as to defining the least critical option, i.e., either return to the aerodrome or land on the beach.c) Forgetfulness - undeterminedIt is possible that, in face of the emergency and under a feeling of anxiety, the pilots forgot to perform the third segment of the procedure prescribed for the takeoff engine failure above V1 emergency, attempting to return to the aerodrome just after the conclusion of the second segment, still at an altitude of 400ft.d) Training - a contributorThe lack of training of the takeoff engine failure above V1 emergency, in the exact way it is prescribed in the Training Program, favored an inadequate performance in face of the problem they were confronted with.The pilots did neither follow the flight profile recommended for the emergency, nor executed the checklist items prescribed after the 400ft.e) Pilot judgment - a contributorThe pilots judged that their priority would be to return for a landing on the runway, but in the opposite direction from the one they had used for taking off, with the turn starting at 400ft, a fact that made it more difficult to fly the aircraft.Up to 400ft, the aircraft maintained a straight flight profile and developed a positive climb gradient. This flight condition favored the accomplishment of the emergency checklist items, in accordance with the prescriptions of the Training Program, with little variation in the application of the flight controls.Upon starting the turn, it would be necessary to find a new measure of pedal deflection compatible with the new condition of banking, and, at the same time, perform the checklist procedures. Therefore, the turn itself represented an increase in the workload. It is worth stressing that the operating engine had appropriate power for the maintenance of the flight.f) Management supervision - a contributorThe supervision by the management did not detect that the instructions given omitted items of the syllabus contained in the Training Program relative to the takeoff engine failure above V1 emergency, both in the ground curriculum and in the flightcurriculum segments.No-one identified that the software being used by the company for the dispatch of the aircraft performed the calculation of the maximum takeoff weight, attributing to the maximum takeoff weight for a takeoff from Recife a value that was in fact the maximum structural weight (6,600Kg).On the day of the accident, there was a weight limitation on account of the temperature. Due to the inbuilt failure of the software, the aircraft took off with an excess in the takeoff weight, resulting in a reduction of the rate of climb.2. Material Factor2.1 Concerning the aircrafta) Manufacturing - undeterminedConsidering the hypothesis that the fatigue process in the blade T52A175 had its origin while the blade was still installed in the Russian operator engine, the method utilized by the engine manufacturer for the evaluation and later reutilization of the used blades would not have been able to guarantee the quality of that blade, which ended up being installed in the position number 27 of the accident aircraft left engine GGT disk.b) Design - undeterminedThe aircraft documentation translated to the English language by the manufacturer did not favor the operation of the aircraft, as it contained confusing texts, differences within a same topic when dealt with by distinct documents, along with translation errors, which made it difficult to be understood, and which may have contributed to the non-execution of the proper procedure relative to the takeoff engine failure above V1 emergency.Especially in regard to the ""ABC switching off"" action, to be taken at 200 ft, the divergence between the ways it is presented by the checklist and the AFM may have contributed to its non-execution by the pilots, degrading the performance of the aircraft.13-07-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CENIPA ,2011

Two of the six occupants were injured.The airplane departed Lagos, Nigeria at 1856 hours for Port Harcourt. The aircraft's first contact with Port Harcourt was at 1914 when the pilot reported maintaining FL330 and estimating POT VOR at 1940. The aircraft was cleared to POT, to maintain FL330 with no delay expected for an ILS Approach to runway 21, QNH 1011. Seven minutes later the flight was cleared to descend to FL150. At 1927 the flight was cleared further down to 3,300ft but the pilot acknowledged 3,500ft. At 1931 the aircraft was re-cleared to FL90 initially due to departing traffic on runway 03 at Port Harcourt. This was followed by new descent clearances first to FL50 and then to 2000ft. At 1936 the flight was cleared for a straight-in ILS approach to runway 21 and to report on the localizer. At 1950, when the flight had changed frequencies to Port Harcourt Tower, the controller asked 5N-BMM to confirm on the glide slope and the crew confirmed ""Charlie, we have three miles to run"". The Tower cleared 5N-BMM to land with surface wind calm but to exercise caution since the runway surface was wet and 5N-BMM responded ""wind calm"". At 1952 the auto voice callout ""minimums minimums"" alerted the crew. The pilot flying, a captain, stated ""I am not on the centerline...I can't see down"". The pilot monitoring, who was also captain, said to the pilot flying ""I am telling you to go down"" and the pilot flying said ""I will go down"", five seconds later the aircraft crashed-landed.The airplane skidded off the runway and impacted a gully and a culvert, causing the right hand main gear to be sheared off.The aircraft suffered substantial damage and the main door was inaccessible, thus the passengers and crew evacuated through the overwing exit close to the starboard engine that was still running. The fire services eventually used their water hose to shutdown the running engine.Causal FactorThe Decision of the pilot to continue the approach without the required visual references.Contributory Factors1) Poor crew co-ordination CRM.2) Pairing two captains together.3) The weather was marginal.14-07-201114-07-201114-07-201114-07-201114-07-2011",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,AIB Nigeria ,2011

The return leg, Flight EI 6305, departed Manchester at 0847. En-route operations were normal and, in consultation with ATC, the aircraft descended and was cleared to self-position to the DERAG waypoint for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 24.At 1008 hrs the aircraft commenced an approach to runway 24 in strong and gusty crosswind conditions. Following a turbulent approach difficulty was experienced in landing the aircraft, which contacted the runway in a nose-down attitude and bounced. A go-around was performed and the aircraft was vectored for a second approach. During this second approach landing turbulence was again experienced. Following bounces the aircraft pitched nose down and contacted the runway heavily in a nose down attitude. The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft nose descended onto the runway. The aircraft sustained damage with directional control being lost. The aircraft came to rest at the junction of the runway and a taxiway.Following engine shutdown the forward cabin crew member advised the cockpit that there was no smoke and that the doors could be opened following which, an evacuation was commenced.PROBABLE CAUSE1.

Both pilots were killed in the accident.Asiana Airlines flight 991 departed Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN) at 0305 on a cargo flight to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport (PVG), China.At 0351, at FL340, the copilot made initial contact with Shanghai Area Control Center (ACC). Three minutes later the copilot radioed, ""Shanghai control, Shanghai control, AAR991 request emergency descent, emergency, declare emergency due to fire main deck. Request descent, and descent to one-zero thousand."" This request was approved.In subsequent communication the copilot stated that they wanted to divert back to Jeju with a descent to FL100. At 0400, Shanghai Control instructed AAR991 to contact Incheon ACC for a radar vector to Jeju, however, AAR991 stated that it was unable to contact on that frequency. The radar data of Incheon ACC shows that at 0401, AAR991 was flying at 8,200 ft at a ground speed of 404 kt on a heading of 033°, and after this, AAR991's altitude, ground speed, and heading changed inconsistently.At 0402 contact was transferred to Fukuoka ACC. The flight then radioed ""Fukuoka AAR991 mayday mayday mayday, we have cargo fire, request direct to Jeju please."" With Fukuoka ACC failing to respond, the crew contacted Shanghai ACC again.Korean Air flight KE886 was used to relay radar vectors and descent instructions from Incheon ACC. The captain then reported rudder control problems to KE886. Control problems appeared to worsen as the captain radioed ""Rudder control... flight control, all are not working."" at 0409. Meanwhile the first officer managed to change frequencies to Jeju ACC, stating ""We have heavy vibration on the airplane, may need to make an emergency landing, emergency ditching."". Last contact was at 0410 when the first officer radioed ""Altitude control is not available due to heavy vibration, going to ditch... ah."" According to radar data the altitude at that time was about 10.000 feet.The airplane then entered a high speed descent and struck the surface of the sea and broke up. The wreckage sank to a depth of about 85 metres.The plane carried 58 tonnes of cargo, including 0.4 tonnes of potentially risky materials such as lithium batteries, paint, amino acid solution and synthetic resin.CausesThe Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) determines the cause of this accident as followsA fire developed on or near the pallets containing dangerous goods but no physical evidence of the cause of the fire was found. The fire rapidly escalated into a large uncontained fire, and this caused some portions of the fuselage to separate from the aircraft in midair, thereby resulting in the crash.Contributing Factors1. Flammable materials like photo-resist (Class 3) were loaded in position ML, and flammable materials like paint, photo-resist, corrosive liquid, and lithium-ion batteries (Class 9) were loaded on one pallet in position PR.2. It was difficult to contain a large scale of fire only by the fire suppression system of a Class E cargo compartment that was not equipped with an active fire suppression system.28-07-201128-07-2011",Cargo,ARAIB ,2011

While waiting for the last passengers to board, the first officer heard a pop and a hissing sound to the right side of his seat. Fire and smoke was seen coming from the right console area below the number 3 window. The captain instructed the first officer to leave the cockpit immediately while the captain used the cockpit fire extinguisher to fight the fire. This attempt was unsuccessful.Meanwhile the crew and passengers expeditiously deplaned and the first officer went looking for someone with a radio to notify the fire services. He finally stopped a car on a service road and called the fire department. The first fire brigade arrived after three minutes and the fire was extinguished.Examination of the aircraft determined that the cockpit was extensively damaged, and two holes were burned through the aircraft external skin just below the First Officers window. In addition, smoke damage occurred throughout the aircraft, and heat damage was found on overhead structures well aft of the cockpit. The crew oxygen system has a number of oxygen lines and hoses running through the area were the fire started. Some of those hoses are electrically conductive, according to research.Probable causes for the accident can be reached through1.

One serious and multiple minor injuries were reported among the 157 passengers and six crewmembers on board the plane.The flight departed Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago on a scheduled flight to Georgetown. The aircraft was cleared for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 06 at Georgetown. This is a 7,448-ft / 2,270-m long asphalt runway. There were no reported anomalies in the en-route profile, although during the descent the aircraft deviated to avoid some thunderstorm cells north and east of the airport. The reported visibility was 9000m. Light rain was encountered during the approach.The pilot reported that after visual contact was made and after crossing the Final Approach Fix (FAF), he disengaged the auto pilot and configured the aircraft for landing. The flight was normal until the aircraft was approaching the runway. Even before the aircraft was over the threshold, the captain commented that he was not landing here.As the flight continued over the runway, comments on the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), revealed that the captain indicated to the first officer that the aircraft was not touching down. A go-around call was made by the captain and acknowledged by the first officer, however three seconds elapsed and the aircraft subsequently touched down approximately 4700ft from the threshold of runway 06, leaving just over 2700 feet of runway surface remaining.Upon touchdown, brake pressure was gradually increased and maximum brake pressure of 3000psi was not achieved until the aircraft was 250ft from the end of the runway or 450ft from the end of the paved area. The ground spoilers were extended on touchdown. The thrust reversers were partially deployed after touchdown. The aircraft did not stop and overran the runway. It went down a slope, impacted the ground and came to rest across a road.CONCLUSION The probable cause of the accident was that the aircraft touched down approximately 4700 feet beyond the runway threshold, some 2700 feet from the end of the runway, as a result of the Captain maintaining excess power during the flare, and upon touching down, failure to utilize the aircrafts full deceleration capability, resulted in the aircraft overrunning the remaining runway and fracturing the fuselage.Contributory FactorsThe Flight Crews indecision as to the execution of a go-around, failure to execute a go-around after the aircraft floated some distance down the runway and their diminished situational awareness contributed to the accident.30-07-201130-07-201130-07-201130-07-2011",International Scheduled Passenger,GCAA-AIT ,2011

There were no serious injuries.Air Nostrum flight 8313 had departed Badajoz (BJZ) on a domestic flight to Barcelona (BCN). The copilot was Pilot Flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.They were cleared for a visual approach to runway 25R. Target speed for the approach was calculated as 138 kts. At 5 NM from the threshold, the aircraft was at an altitude of 1,844 ft, meaning it was 198 ft above the theoretical 3° approach slope to the runway. Its IAS was 145 kts. Between miles 4.5 and 5, the aircraft descended at an angle slightly in excess of 3°, such that its excess altitude was gradually decreasing.As stated by the crew, at around the 4.5 NM point, they encountered a cloud layer. In an effort to maintain visual conditions, the PF decided to fly above the clouds, which forced them to climb.This situation lasted until 2.8 NM, where the crew regained visual contact with the runway. By this point, the aircraft was about 725 ft above the theoretical 3° approach slope. Its IAS was 132 kts. The crew then realized that their approach did not meet the stabilized approach criteria, meaning they had to go around. Seconds before, on the weather radar, they had noticed a storm cell. In light of this, the captain decided that the standard go-around maneuver, which consists of climbing on the runway heading (246 radial on the ""BCN"" VOR) to an altitude of 3,000 ft, was not viable, since it would force them into the storm cell.He also considered the possibility of going around to the right or left, but ruled out both options due to the presence of mountains to the right and of other aircraft to the left. From there to the 1 NM point, the aircraft descended at less than 1,000 ft/min, meaning that while its excess altitude decreased, the aircraft was still at an altitude of 616 ft at the end of this segment and they still had not lined up with the runway centerline.When the aircraft was at an altitude of 600 ft, the captain decided to take the controls. He deployed the speed brakes. The descent rate increased substantially, reaching an average value of 3,000 ft-min. Two seconds later, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) began issuing warnings. This continued for 13 seconds, until the aircraft reached a radio altitude of 50 ft, at which point the GPWS warnings are inhibited by design.The aircraft flew over the runway 25R threshold at an altitude of 365 ft, which translates into an excess altitude of 315 ft above the theoretical 3° slope.Once over the runway, the speed brakes retracted, though they started deploying again 1 s later, remaining in that position until 20 s after the aircraft landed.The aircraft landed 5 s later. Only two of the three gear legs, the right main leg and the nose leg, made contact. High vertical acceleration values were recorded during this impact, with the peak value being 3.66 g's. The aircraft bounced and became airborne again for 2 s, after which it made contact with the runway, landing hard with a maximum vertical acceleration value of 2.45 g's. The spoilers deployed immediately. This time the aircraft did not bounce and the crew began to brake. The rest of the landing run proceeded normally. An inspection revealed structural damage.CAUSESThis accident was caused byThe execution of a destabilized approach brought about by the captain's decision to try to descend at rates in excess of 2,500 ft/min and with the air brakes deployed from 600 ft AGL to the ground.The following contributing factors have also been identifiedThe presence of an adverse weather situation that was different from expected and the lack of communication between the two pilots, which caused the crew to lose situational awareness and to ignore the EGPWS warnings.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CIAIAC ,2011

Four passengers sustained serious injuries.The airplane operated on IrAero flight 103 from Irkutsk (IKT) to Chita (HTA), Blagoveshchensk (BQS) and Khabarovsk (KHV). The flight to Chita was uneventful and the airplane departed Chita at 1111 and arrived near Blagoveshchensk about 1400. The approach was carried out in conditions of reduced visibility , strong and heavy rainfall and strong atmospheric turbulence associated with thunderstorms. The airplane deviated to the right and touched down prematurely to the right of the runway 36 threshold. It collided with trees at a large vertical and forward speed.Probable cause (translated from Russian)The immediate cause of the accident without casualties with An-24RV RA-46561, during an ILS approach in weather conditions far below the meteorological conditions of the commander, the airfield and aircraft, as well as the presence of harmful (adverse) weather phenomena (thunderstorm, heavy rain, strong turbulence), was the failure of the crew to go around when they failed to observe landmarks while descending to a height well below decision height, as well as lack of appropriate response and action required after the triggering of the ground proximity warning system, which led to a collision with obstacles and aircraft ground in controlled flight (CFIT) and its destruction. Contributing factors were - underestimation by the crew of meteorological conditions at the aerodrome of landing, expressed in making the wrong decision on the execution of the approach in terms of thunderstorm and torrential rain; - unsatisfactory flight meteorological services, providing information  to the controller and later the crew on the actual visibility, cloud height, direction and strength of the wind at the airport, and the actual conditions that were significantly worse than the established minimum; - permission by the ATM to conduct an approach in the presence of dangerous (adverse) weather phenomena (storm, heavy rain storm);   - inadequate manning, which led to the inclusion in the crew of the second pilot who carried out the first flight after a long break without passing the necessary preparation and training; - poor crew interaction and failure to use available instruments, in terms of informing the captain about reaching decision height, no decision by the captain to continue landing or go around and the failure of the second pilot actions to initiate the go around in these conditions.08-08-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2011

The An-12 landed at Magadan at 1254 after an uneventful flight. The flight was refuelled and departed Magadan at 1437 for the final leg of the flight. The cruising altitude of 7500 m was reached at 1517. Shortly afterwards, a fuel leak was noted in the no. 4 engine. At 1522 the crew requested a descent to 6600 m, and a return to Magadan. This was approved. The crew shut down the no. 4 engine and feathered the prop. The engine was on fire, and at 1527 the crew reported the fire and stated that they were conducting an emergency descent.The crew had reported a fuel leak and an engine fire and indicated that they were returning to Magadan. The airplane did not reach Magadan and contact was lost. The wreckage was located the following day and no survivors were found.RA-11125 was the oldest plane of the Russian commercial air fleet.CONCLUSION (translated from Russian)The cause of the crash of the An-12AP RA-11125 was the loss of lateral control because of the loss of bearing properties of the left wing of the plane and a possible violation of the integrity of the control wiring rod of the left aileron, which led to intensive airplane rotation with a roll to the left and the collision with the slope of the mountain.The cause of the loss of the bearing properties of the airplane's left wing and a possible violation of the integrity of the left aileron control rod wiring was a fire, arising in flight at the aft compartment of the engine nr.1 nacelle which spread to the wing.The fire most likely started when leaking fuel from fuel line connections from the nr. 1 engine low-pressure pump ignited in contact with a hot part of the engine. Due to the complete destruction of the aircraft, it was not possible to clearly establish the place and cause of the leak that led to the leak of fuel.Impossibility of extinguishing the fire at an early stage by a fire fighting system could have contributed to a delay in engine nr. 1 to be turned off (at least 2 minutes after the fuel leak detection) due to lack of An-12 crew instructions on actions at fuel leakage from under the engine cover in flight.Mountainous nature of the underlying terrain, the lack of visibility over land because of overcast cloud and lack of time due to the ongoing fire, did not allow the crew to choose a site and make an emergency landing.1963CCCP-11125Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP), Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Manufacturing Association (KnAAPO)1993RA-11125Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Manufacturing Association (KnAAPO)13 OCT 19997RA-11125Atlant-Soyuz Airlines17 FEB 2000RA-11125Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Manufacturing Association (KnAAPO)2010RA-11125Avis-Amur",Cargo,MAK ,2011

20-AUG-2011,Boeing 737-210C,C-GNWN,First Air,12,near Resolute Air...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20110820-0,Approach (APR),Destroyed,Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) - Mountain,"A Boeing 737-200 passenger plane was destroyed when it flew into terrain while on approach to Resolute Bay Airport, NU (YRB), Canada. There were 11 passengers and four crew members on board. Eight passengers and all four crew members were killed.The airplane had departed Yellowknife Airport, NT (YZF) on a domestic charter flight to Resolute Bay. During the approach to Runway 35T, the aircraft impacted a hill at 396 feet above sea level (asl) and about 1 nautical mile east of the midpoint of the Resolute Bay Airport runway which, itself, is at 215 feet asl. The crew had initiated a go-around 2 seconds before impact. At this time, the flaps were set to position 40, the landing gear was down and locked, the speed was 157 knots and the final landing checklist was complete.In the hours before the accident, the weather in Resolute Bay was variable with fluctuations in visibility and cloud ceiling. Forty minutes before the accident, the visibility was 10 miles in light drizzle with an overcast ceiling at 700 feet above ground level (agl). A weather observation taken shortly after the accident, reported visibility of 5 miles in light drizzle and mist with an overcast ceiling of 300 feet agl.TSB stated the following findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The late initiation and subsequent management of the descent resulted in the aircraft turning onto final approach 600 feet above the glideslope, increasing the crews workload and reducing their capacity to assess and resolve the navigational issues during the remainder of the approach.2. When the heading reference from the compass systems was set during initial descent, there was an error of -8°. For undetermined reasons, further compass drift during the arrival and approach resulted in compass errors of at least -17° on final approach.3. As the aircraft rolled out of the turn onto final approach to the right of the localizer, the captain likely made a control wheel roll input that caused the autopilot to revert from VOR/LOC capture to MAN and HDG HOLD mode. The mode change was not detected by the crew.4. On rolling out of the turn, the captains horizontal situation indicator displayed a heading of 330°, providing a perceived initial intercept angle of 17° to the inbound localizer track of 347°. However, due to the compass error, the aircrafts true heading was 346°. With 3° of wind drift to the right, the aircraft diverged further right of the localizer.5. The crews workload increased as they attempted to understand and resolve the ambiguity of the track divergence, which was incongruent with the perceived intercept angle and expected results.6. Undetected by the pilots, the flight directors likely reverted to AUTO APP intercept mode as the aircraft passed through 2.5° right of the localizer, providing roll guidance to the selected heading (wings-level command) rather than to the localizer (left-turn command).7. A divergence in mental models degraded the crews ability to resolve the navigational issues. The wings-level command on the flight director likely assured the captain that the intercept angle was sufficient to return the aircraft to the selected course; however, the first officer likely put more weight on the positional information of the track bar and GPS.8. The crews attention was devoted to solving the navigational problem, which delayed the configuration of the aircraft for landing. This problem solving was an additional task, not normally associated with this critical phase of flight, which escalated the workload.9. The first officer indicated to the captain that they had full localizer deflection. In the absence of standard phraseology applicable to his current situation, he had to improvise the go-around suggestion. Although full deflection is an undesired aircraft state requiring a go-around, the captain continued the approach.10. The crew did not maintain a shared situational awareness. As the approach continued, the pilots did not effectively communicate their respective perception, understanding, and future projection of the aircraft state.11. Although the company had a policy that required an immediate go-around in the event that an approach was unstable below 1000 feet above field elevation, no go-around was initiated. This policy had not been operationalized with any procedural guidance in the standard operating procedures.12. The captain did not interpret the first officers statement of ""3 mile and not configged"" as guidance to initiate a go-around. The captain continued the approach and called for additional steps to configure the aircraft.13. The first officer was task-saturated, and he thus had less time and cognitive capacity to develop and execute a communication strategy that would result in the captain changing his course of action.14. Due to attentional narrowing and task saturation, the captain likely did not have a high-level overview of the situation. This lack of overview compromised his ability to identify and manage risk.15. The crew initiated a go-around after the ground proximity warning system ""sink rate"" alert occurred, but there was insufficient altitude and time to execute the manoeuvre and avoid collision with terrain.16. The first officer made many attempts to communicate his concerns and suggest a go-around. Outside of the two-communication rule, there was no guidance provided to address a situation in which the pilot flying is responsive but is not changing an unsafe course of action. In the absence of clear policies or procedures allowing a first officer to escalate from an advisory role to taking control, this first officer likely felt inhibited from doing so.17. The crews crew resource management was ineffective. First Airs initial and recurrent crew resource management training did not provide the crew with sufficient practical strategies to assist with decision making and problem solving, communication, and workload management.18. Standard operating procedure adaptations on FAB6560 resulted in ineffective crew communication, escalated workload leading to task saturation, and breakdown in shared situational awareness. First Airs supervisory activities did not detect the standard operating procedure adaptations within the Yellowknife B737 crew base.20-08-201120-08-201120-08-201120-08-201120-08-201120-08-2011",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2011

Both airplanes were being operated as visual flight rules (VFR) charter flights in visual meteorological conditions when the accident occurred. The Cessna 208B was operated by Grant Aviation and the Cessna 207 was operated by Ryan Air. The sole occupant of the Cessna 208B sustained fatal injuries. The sole occupant of the Cessna 207 was uninjured. Both airplanes sustained substantial damage during the midair collision. After the collision, the Cessna 208B descended, uncontrolled, and impacted tundra-covered terrain. A postcrash fire consumed most of the wreckage. The Cessna 207 was further damaged during a forced landing on tundra-covered terrain. Both airplanes were based at the Bethel Airport, Alaska. The Cessna 208B departed from the Toksook Bay Airport (OOK) about 1325, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect for the flight to Bethel. The Cessna 207 departed from the Tununak Airport, Alaska, about 1315, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect for the return flight to Bethel.Both pilots had a close personal relationship. After takeoff from Tununak, the pilot of the Cessna 207 talked with the pilot of the Cessna 208B on a prearranged, discreet radio frequency, and the two agreed to rendezvous for the flight back to Bethel. She said that while in cruise level flight at 1,200 feet msl, en route to Bethel, the pilot of the Cessna 208B flew his airplane along the left side of her airplane, and they continued to talk via radio. She said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B then unexpectedly and unannounced climbed his airplane above, and overtop of her airplane. She immediately told the pilot of the 208B that she could not see him, and she was concerned about where he was. She said the 208B pilot then said, in part ""Whatever you do, don't pull up."" Moments later, the next thing she recalls was the 208B's impact with her airplane's right wing.The 207 pilot reported that after the impact, she saw the 208B pass underneath her airplane, and it began a gradual descent, which steepened as the airplane continued to the left and away from her airplane. She said that she told the pilot of the 208B that she thought she was going to crash. The pilot of the 208B stated that he also thought he was going to crash. She said that she watched as the 208B continued to descend, then it entered a steep, vertical, nose down descent, before it collided with the ground. She said a postcrash fire started instantaneously upon impact. The 207 pilot said that while struggling to maintain control of her airplane, she was unable to maintain altitude, and she selected an area of rolling, tundra-covered terrain as a forced landing site. She said that during the emergency descent, she had limited roll control, and the airplane's stall horn was on during the entire emergency approach. The airplane touched down on the soft terrain, and the nose landing gear collapsed. The Cessna 208B's severed vertical stabilizer and rudder assemblies were found about one-half mile west of the main wreckage site, and along the two airplanes' reported flight route. A large portion of the Cessna 207's right aileron was found near the 208's rudder and stabilizer.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance while performing an unexpected and unannounced abrupt maneuver, resulting in a midair collision between the two airplanes.""02-09-201102-09-201102-09-2011",Cargo,NTSB ,2011

The airplane had left Santiago (SCL) at 1352 on a flight to Isla Robinsón Crusoe, one of the islands of the Juan Fernández archipelago. On the plane was a team from Televisión Nacional de Chile, members of NGOs, officials of the Council of Culture and staff of the Chilean Air Force. They were going to visit the islands to see the progress of relief activities following the 2010 earthquake.The aircraft finally took off at 1651 UTC (1351 local). The flight enroute encountered adverse weather conditions a strong permanent headwind with varying intensity, numerous clouds, and storms that forced major changes in heading and flight level, with the aircraft climbing up to FL150 versus the FL090 authorized level.The aircraft arrived at the island at 1948 UTC, after a two hour and 57 minute flight. A local representative was waiting on the airfield to welcome the aircraft and passengers. He observed that the aircraft flew over runway 14 (north to south) and performed a teardrop maneuver to the right to an invert heading approaching to runway 32. When the aircraft was on the runway 32 heading, a balked landing was experienced with high and gusty crosswinds, with the aircraft deviating to the right of the runway.An open left turn for a new approach to runway 32 was initiated through the channel between the airfield and Santa Clara Island; but the aircraft disappeared below the hills around the airport, and it was never seen again.Investigators concluded that the aircraft struck the ocean in an abnormal attitude with a bank angle significantly past a 90-degree left bank. The aircraft was inverted and still rolling to the left while side slipping to the left. The break-up sequence shows the aircraft was flying forward, but it was also quickly side slipping to the left.The aircraft nose was also dropping; however, the aircraft did not cartwheel. It rolled inverted while the outer portion of the left wing was slicing into the water and literally shattering from water forces.At the same time, the aircraft nose and cockpit were destroyed when they impacted the water and rotated some 30 degrees to the right while being crushed rearward by water forces.When the aircraft rolled totally inverted, the right wing slammed into the ocean and broke into three large sections. The top of the fuselage was rippled like an accordion by water friction forces, and the rear fuselage and dorsal fin displayed hydraulic crushing on the right side.Investigators concluded that the accident was caused by the loss of control of the airplane while performing the tailwind leg through the channel between the islands of Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara to an estimated height of 650 feet or less, during the circuit approach to Runway 32 in a very low trajectory (with little height difference above the runway), where very adverse airflow conditions were found, including wind shear, which exposed the crew to extreme flight conditions.Adverse airflow conditions were the results of a combination of different factors, including - very unstable atmosphere, with strong turbulence and possibly eventually powerful down gusts arising from the presence of open cells after a front passed.- the presence of the two counter-rotating vortexes in the Santa Clara Island downwind wake.- the presence of strong and gusty crosswinds that were very variable in strength and direction in a very short time.",Military,,2011

There were no injuries among the three crew members and 44 passengers. The airplane was operating as United Express flight 3363 from Chicago-O'Hare (ORD). At 1524, the terminal air traffic controller (ATC) advised the flight crew that it was starting to rain heavily. About 2 minutes later, the aircraft intercepted the glideslope for the ILS to runway 32. Final descent was initiated, the landing gear was extended, and the flaps were selected to 22°. Upon contacting the tower controller, the flight crew was advised that moderate rain had just started at the airport and the wind was reported as 310° magnetic at 10 knots.Later on in the approach the flaps were selected to 45°. The tower controller then advised the flight crew that the wind had changed to 320°M at 13 knots gusting to 20 knots. To compensate for the increased wind speed, the flight crew increased the VAPP to 140 KIAS.About 1 minute later, at 1529, the aircraft crossed the threshold of runway 32 at about 45 feet agl, at an airspeed of 139 KIAS. As the aircraft crossed the runway threshold, the intensity of the rain increased, so the flight crew selected the windshield wipers to high. When the aircraft was about 20 feet agl, engine power was reduced and a flare was commenced.Just before touchdown, the aircraft encountered a downpour sufficient to obscure the crews view of the runway. Perceiving a sudden increase in descent rate, at approximately 5 feet agl, the captain applied maximum thrust on both engines. The master caution light illuminated, and a voice warning stated that the flaps were not in a takeoff configuration. Maximum thrust was maintained for 7 seconds.The aircraft touched down smoothly 2700 feet beyond the threshold at 119 KIAS; the airspeed was increasing, and the aircraft became airborne again. The aircraft touched down a second time at 3037 feet beyond the threshold, with the airspeed increasing through 125 KIAS. Airspeed on touchdown peaked at 128 KIAS as the nosewheel was lowered to the ground, and then the thrust levers were retarded to flight idle. The outboard spoilers almost immediately deployed, and about 8 seconds later, the inboard spoilers deployed. The aircraft was about 20 feet right of the runway centreline when it touched down for the second time.Once the nosewheel was on the ground, the captain applied maximum brakes. The flight crew almost immediately noted that the aircraft began skidding. The captain then requested the first officer to apply maximum brakes as well. The aircraft continued to skid, and no significant brake pressure was recorded until about 14 seconds after the outboard spoilers deployed, when brake pressure suddenly increased to its maximum. During this time, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft back to the runway centreline.As the aircraft skidded down the runway, it began to yaw to the left. Full right rudder was applied, but was ineffective in correcting the left yaw.At some point during the landing roll, the captain partially applied the emergency/parking brake (EPB), and when no braking action was felt, the EPB was engaged further. With no perceivable deceleration being felt, the EPB was stowed.The aircraft continued to skid down the runway until about 7500 feet from the threshold, at which point it started skidding sideways along the runway.At 1530, the nosewheel exited the paved surface, 8120 feet from the threshold, at approximately 53 knots, on a heading of 271°M. The aircraft came to rest on a heading of 211°M, just off the left side of the paved surface. After coming to a stop, the flight crew carried out the emergency shutdown procedure as per the company Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), and consulted with the flight attendant on the status of everyone in the passenger cabin. The flight crew determined that there was no immediate threat and decided to hold the passengers on board.When the aircraft exited the runway surface, the tower activated the crash alarm. The CYOW airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) services responded, and were on scene approximately 3 minutes after the activation of the crash alarm. Once ARFF personnel had conducted a thorough exterior check of the aircraft, they informed the flight crew that there was a fuel leak.The captain then called for an immediate evacuation of the aircraft. The passengers evacuated through the main cabin door, and moved to the runway as directed by the flight crew and ARFF personnel. The evacuation was initiated approximately 12 minutes after the aircraft came to a final stop.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Heavy rainfall before and during the landing resulted in a 4-6 mm layer of water contaminating the runway.2. The occurrence aircrafts airspeed during final approach exceeded the company-prescribed limits for stabilized approach criteria. As a result, the aircraft crossed the runway threshold at a higher than recommended VREF airspeed.3. A go-around was not performed, as per standard operating procedures, when the aircrafts speed was greater than 5 knots above the appropriate approach speed during the stabilized portion of the approach.4. The application of engine thrust just before touchdown caused the aircraft to touch down 3037 feet from the threshold at a higher than recommended airspeed.5. The combination of a less than firm landing and underinflated tires contributed to the aircraft hydroplaning.6. The emergency/parking brake was applied during the landing roll, which disabled the anti-skid braking system and prolonged the skid.7. The aircraft lost directional control as a result of hydroplaning and veered off the runway.04-09-201104-09-2011",International Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2011

The Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) reported that the flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 23. Before takeoff the crew selected flaps at 20 degrees (takeoff position) and the stabilizer at -8.7 degrees (nose up). A control check was performed. The runway length available for takeoff was 3000 metres and V1 speed was calculated to be 190 km/h. However, the correct V1 speed should have been 210 km/h.Weather was fine with wind from 360 degrees at 3 m/sec., a visibility of 10 km, with significant stratocumulus clouds at a lower limit of 990 m. The temperature was +17.8 degrees C. Takeoff was initiated at nominal engine thrust. At a speed of 185 km/h the nose wheel lifted off the runway but the pitch angle did not increase. After six seconds takeoff mode power was selected. However, the speed momentarily decreased. The crew used additional elevator and trimmed the stabilizer to 9.5 degrees nose up. The airplane still did not become airborne. It travelled past the end of the runway onto the grass, finally lifting off about 400 metres past the threshold. The aircraft struck a localizer antenna and rapidly attained a 20 degrees nose-up attitude, reaching a height of 5-6 metres. The airplane then rolled left, struck the ground and broke up on the side of the Volga River.PROBABLE CAUSE It was determined that- the crew calculated the V1 speed to be 190 km/h; however this was incorrect as it should have been 220 km/h;- the copilot had medical issues, he had leg coordination disturbances and the deep sensibility disorders of lower extremities. The medicine Phenobarbital, which has a negative impact on the nervous system, was found in his blood which degraded his performance;- while the captain had over 1300 hours of experience flying Yak-42 aircraft, he flew the smaller Yak-40 aircraft before that and had more experience in those aircraft. The same applied to the copilot. Both aircraft have a different method of braking and the captain or copilot (it could not be concluded who pushed the brakes) probably held his feet on the pedals during takeoff in a similar manner that he had used on the Yak-40. In the accident he inadvertently activated the brakes while pulling on the controls to lift the nose for takeoff.The investigators established that there were at least four contributing factors, including a lack of pilot training, the absence of control over the crews preparation for flight, the pilots failure to follow standard takeoff procedures and poor coordination between the crew during the takeoff.07-09-201107-09-201107-09-201107-09-201107-09-201107-09-201107-09-201107-09-201107-09-2011",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2011
09-SEP-2011,Cessna 208B Grand Caravan,PK-VVE,Susi Air,2,near Notnare Vill...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20110909-0,En route (ENR),Destroyed,Overloaded  Loss of control,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan I was destroyed when it crashed in the Yahukimo District, Indonesia. Both crew members were killed.The airplane was being operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Wamena Airport to Kenyam Aerodrome in Papua, Indonesia. The flight was being conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) and the pilot reported to ATC that the planned altitude was 9,500 feet.On board the aircraft were two pilots, a manifested load of diesel drums and grocery items, and a non-manifested load of 25 bags of rice weighing 827 lb (375 kg). The takeoff weight, based on the manifested cargo and the additional load of rice was estimated by the investigation to be 9,681 lb (4,391 Kg) which was 619 lb (281 Kg) above the certificated maximum takeoff weight. Also, the aircraft Centre of Gravity (C of G) was outside the certificated C of G envelope.The aircraft took off from Wamena runway 15 at 1217 local time. The aircraft was then flown along a track toward Kenyam which was consistent with the route used by other company pilots and previously flown by the pilot in command. The additional loading contributed to a reduced rate of climb during the flight which resulted in the aircraft being below 10,000 ft as it approached the high terrain. This altitude was 1,500 ft lower than the altitude specified in the operator's route guide for operations between Wamena and Kenyam, and lower than the altitude flown by other company pilots when operating in the area, including three other flights on the day of the accident which overflew the high terrain between 11,200 and 12,500 ft.At 122943, as the aircraft approached the high terrain at an altitude of 9,538 ft, the airspeed commenced decreasing which was accompanied by the average rate of climb increasing to about 390 fpm. It is probable that the pilots recognized the proximity of the terrain and attempted to improve the aircraft's angle of climb by decelerating towards the best angle of climb speed of 72 kts. The recorded data showed that 31 seconds after the airspeed started to decrease, the engine power varied with a maximum engine torque of 1,675 ft/lb being recorded at 123030 with changes in the other engine parameters being consistent with a selection of a higher power setting. This is likely to have been associated with the pilot's attempts to improve terrain clearance.The recorded data then showed the aircraft in a descending right turn for about 6 seconds. The altitude reduced over a period of 4 seconds from 9,865 ft to 9,728 ft at an average rate of descent of about 2,000 fpm. This turn was likely to have been initiated to either avoid cloud or improve terrain clearance. The aircraft subsequently commenced to roll to the left at 123035 with the left roll continuing for the following 14 seconds. It was likely that the left turn was initiated to avoid either cloud or terrain. During the left turn, the angle of bank reached a maximum value of 46° and the aircraft descended from 9,728 ft to 9,045 ft at a high rate of descent. The airspeed also increased from 92 kts to 122 kts during the descent. The engine power was reduced to idle soon after the aircraft commenced descending which was most likely due to the handling pilot attempting to recover from the high descent rate and increasing airspeed. The recorded data indicated that three EGPWS alerts activated during the descent.The aircraft had stopped descending at 123050 and had commenced climbing with a reducing left angle of bank when the airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of 9,100 feet.Factors that contributed to the accident are as followsa. The aircraft was loaded to a weight in excess of the maximum certificated takeoff weight.b. The aircraft climb performance was adversely affected by the aircraft being operated above the certificated maximum takeoff weight.c. The aircraft approached high terrain along the proposed route at an altitude which was below that specified in the operator's route guide.d. The aircraft entered a high rate of descent during a terrain avoidance maneuver.e. Recovery from the abnormal flight path was not achieved before the aircraft collided with terrain.09-09-201109-09-201109-09-2011NOV 2007N41176Rangeflyers2007PK-VVESusi Air",Cargo,NTSC Indonesia ,2011

An IFR flight plan had been filed. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Quito Approach Control vectored the flight for an approach to runway 35. About 1904 the crew selected the flaps for landing. Immediately the EICAS screen displayed a SLAT/FLAP system fault. The crew then attempted to resolve this problem by resetting the system. Five attempts were made without success. The slats remained in position 0 and the flaps had moved to position 2. The crew did not use the procedures established by Embraer and decided to continue the approach and landing. The airplane touched down 880 metres down the runway and was not able to stop on the runway. It rolled off the runway, impacted antennas of the instrument landing system before it collided with a brick wall 300 metres from the runway end.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The Board of Inquiry estimated that the probable cause of this accident was the crew's decision to continue the approach and landing without carrying out the procedures (ABNORMAL AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES) established by EMBRAER in the Quick Reference Handbook for when malfunctions occur in the slat/flap system, resulting in a landing too far down the runway.""16-09-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2011

Both pilots were killed and five of the seven passengers were injured.The airplane had departed from Thor Lake, NT at 1248 on a flight to the Yellowknife Waterdome. The first officer (FO) was acting as the pilot flying (PF) in the right seat, and the captain was the pilot not flying (PNF) in the left seat. The crew obtained weather information from the Yellowknife Airport automatic terminal information service (ATIS) and briefed their planned approach to the waterdrome. When joining a left base for landing, C-GARW was advised by the Yellowknife Airport control tower, located about 6 nautical miles (11 km) west of the waterdrome, that the winds at the airport were variable from the southwest at 10 knots, gusting to 30 knots. Due to the 2 to 3-foot waves (rollers) on the lake, the crew planned their approach so as to land close to the shore and to avoid entering the passage between the shore and Jolliffe Island. The captain also advised that the airspeed should be kept above 80 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), which is 10 KIAS above the normal approach speed of 70 KIAS, for the full-flap (37.5°) approach and landing. During the approach, the captain cautioned the FO twice about the airspeed getting too low. The aircraft touched down in the intended landing area and bounced, then contacted the water a second time with the right float first. The float dug in, and the aircraft yawed to the right, turning towards the shore. The stall warning sounded for about 0.3 seconds.Without declaring that he was taking control, the captain placed his right hand on the power lever over the FO's left hand and initiated full power for a go-around. C-GARW lifted off in a nose-high, right-wing-low attitude, in a right turn that continued at a low altitude over the shore and toward the buildings in Old Town, Yellowknife. At this time, the captain called for the flaps to be raised to 20°, to which the FO responded. However, the flaps were not moved before impact. The right wing contacted power lines, causing the aircraft to rotate to a nose-down attitude. The bottom of the floats then contacted the side of a 3-storey office building. C-GARW dropped to the ground on its nose section, then cart-wheeled to its left into an adjacent parking lot. The stall warning intermittently activated throughout the go-around until just prior to impact.The total elapsed time from the initiation of the go-around to the command that flaps be set to 20° was about 4 seconds, and, from that command to the final impact, about 6 seconds. The maximum altitude gained was approximately 50 feet above ground.Numerous witnesses to the accident were on scene immediately to assist in evacuating the passengers. There was no fire, although a considerable amount of fuel was spilled.FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS1. Airspeed fluctuations at touchdown, coupled with gusty wind conditions, caused a bounced landing.2. Improper go-around techniques during the recovery from the bounced landing resulted in a loss of control.3. It is possible that confused crew coordination during the attempted go-around contributed to the loss of control.22-09-201117 JUL 1973N200DADowntown Airlines31 DEC 1975C-GARWPtarmigan Airways17 JAN 1997C-GARWBradley Air Services24 JUN 1998C-GARWFirst Air27 JUN 2001C-GARWArctic Sunwest",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2011

There were 32 people on board. All three crew members and one passenger survived. The airplane operated on Airlines PNG flight CG-1600 from Port Moresby (POM) to Madang (MAG) via Lae-Nadzab (LAE). The aircraft departed Lae at 1647 and climbed to FL160 en route to Madang. The flight progressed normally and the flight was transferred to Madang Air Traffic Control (ATC) at 1710. The descent profile on this sector was steep because of the proximity of the Finisterre Ranges to Madang and the pilot-in-command (PIC), who was the handling pilot, was hand-flying the aircraft because the autopilot was unserviceable. At 1712, in response to a request from Madang Tower, the flight crew stated the aircraft was 24 NM from Madang, leaving 13,000 feet on descent. The pilot-in-command conducted a low power, steep descent with the propellers set at 900 revolutions per minute (RPM) in an attempt to get below cloud in order to be able to see across the ocean to Madang. Neither pilot noticed the aircraft's speed increasing to its maximum operating speed; when this speed was reached, a warning sounded in the cockpit. The pilot-in-command pulled the power levers backwards, through the flight idle gate and into the ground beta range. Moments later, at 10,090 feet, both propellers oversped simultaneously and exceeded their maximum permitted revolutions per minute (rpm) by in excess of 60 percent. The overspeeding propellers back-drove the turbines in the engines (instead of the engine turbines driving the propellers) and this caused severe damage to the left engine. The right engine was not as badly damaged; its propeller feathered due to a system malfunction so that the propeller was no longer back-driving the turbine. It was not possible, however, for the pilots to unfeather the right propeller and generate useable thrust from the right engine, which meant that a forced landing without power was inevitable.Use of the landing gear and flaps was not considered by the pilots, and they were not extended, although the flaps could have been extended until the engines were shut down before impact and the landing gear could have been extended at any time. If the landing gear and flaps had been extended, the impact could have been less severe. The aircraft thus force-landed gear-up on sparsely timbered terrain on the northern side of the Buang River, 33 km south east of Madang township. During the impact sequence, it was severely damaged while colliding with trees and the ground, and an intense fuel-fed fire began.Villagers who had heard and witnessed the aircraft in the final stages of its descent proceeded to the crash site to find the fuselage severely disrupted and engulfed in flames. They assisted the four survivors and took them to the nearest first-aid post.Contributing safety factors- The Pilot-in-Command moved the power levers rearwards below the flight idle gate shortly after the VMO overspeed warning sounded. This means that the release triggers were lifted during the throttle movement. - The power levers were moved further behind the flight idle gate leading to ground beta operation in flight, loss of propeller speed control, double propeller overspeed, and loss of usable forward thrust, necessitating an off-field landing. - A significant number of DHC-8-100, -200, and -300 series aircraft worldwide did not have a means of preventing movement of the power levers below the flight idle gate in flight, or a means to prevent such movement resulting in a loss of propeller speed control.13-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201113-10-201104 NOV 1988C-GETIde Havilland Canada09 DEC 1988B-15203Great China AirlinesDEC 1995Bombardier Aircraft TradingDEC 1995ZK-NESAnsett New Zealand04 SEP 2000ZK-NESQantas New ZealandAPR 2001ZK-NESQantas New ZealandSEP 2002ZK-NESOrigin Pacific Airways01 AUG 2003P2-MCJAirlines PNG",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2011

The crew requested a return to Vancouver and ATC cleared the aircraft to descend on vectors. During the descent they were asked if fire and rescue were needed and they declined. On short final the aircraft suddenly rolled left, pitched down and collided with the ground and a car. There was a post impact fire. All on board were rescued, however the pilot died a few hours later in hospital. The co-pilot succumbed to his injuries 2 weeks after the accident.FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS1. During routine aircraft maintenance, it is likely that the left-engine oil-reservoir cap was left unsecured.2. There was no complete pre-flight inspection of the aircraft, resulting in the unsecured engine oil-reservoir cap not being detected, and the left engine venting significant oil during operation.3. A non-mandatory modification, designed to limit oil loss when the engine oil cap is left unsecure, had not been made to the engines.4. Oil that leaked from the left engine while the aircraft was repositioned was pointed out to the crew, who did not determine its source before the flight departure.5. On final approach, the aircraft slowed to below VREF speed. When power was applied, likely only to the right engine, the aircraft speed was below that required to maintain directional control, and it yawed and rolled left, and pitched down.6. A partially effective recovery was likely initiated by reducing the right engines power; however, there was insufficient altitude to complete the recovery, and the aircraft collided with the ground.7. Impact damage compromised the fuel system. Ignition sources resulting from metal friction, and possibly from the aircrafts electrical system, started fires.8. The damaged electrical system remained powered by the battery, resulting in arcing that may have ignited fires, including in the cockpit area.9. Impact-related injuries sustained by the pilots and most of the passengers limited their ability to extricate themselves from the aircraft.27-10-2011",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2011

One passenger sustained serious injuries. The flight departed from Stuart-Witham Field, FL (SUA) at 1900. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR), flight plan was filed. The main landing gear touched down about 1,650 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. The nosegear then touched down 2.4 seconds later and about 2,120 feet beyond the approach end of the runway, with about 2,680 feet of runway remaining. The pilot in command stated that he then applied the brakes but thought they were not working; he had not yet activated the thrust reversers. He alerted the second in command, who also depressed the brake pedals with no apparent results. The PIC suggested a go-around and advanced the power levers from the idle position to the takeoff position. The second in command said it was too late, and the power levers were then returned to the idle position 6 seconds later. The power levers were moved to the reverse thrust position 8 seconds after that and remained in that position for the duration of the accident sequence; both thrust reversers deployed when commanded. During landing rollout the airplane departed the runway, crossed a 600-foot overrun, impacted the far side of a ditch, crossed a dirt road, cleared another ditch, and came to a stop 820 feet from the departure end of the runway. Although armed, the airbrakes did not deploy upon touchdown; the data available was inconclusive to determine what position the throttles were in at touchdown and why the airbrakes did not deploy. It is likely that the pilots did not detect the wheel braking because its effect was less than expected with the airplane at full power and with the airbrakes stowed.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot in command's failure to follow the normal landing procedures (placing engines into reverse thrust first and then brake), his delayed decision to continue the landing or go-around, and the flight crew's failure to follow emergency procedures once a perceived loss of brakes occurred. Contributing to the seriousness of the passenger's injury was the improper securing of the passenger seat by maintenance personnel.""31-10-201131-10-201131-10-201131-10-201131-10-201131-10-2011",Private,NTSB ,2011

No one was injured.Flight LO16 operated on a flight from Newark, NJ, U.S.A. During the flight the airplane suffered a central hydraulic system failure. About 1316, while on approach to Warsaw's runway 33, the crew managed to deploy the flaps for landing but the undercarriage could not be lowered. The airplane entered a holding pattern at 2750 feet but the gear could not be deployed. In the meantime a pair of Polish Air Force F-16 fighters was deployed and their pilots were able to visually confirm that it was indeed a problem with the landing gear rather than a problem with the annunciators. The crew then decided to carry out a gear-up landing on runway 33 at 1435.Causes of the accident1. Failure of the hydraulic hose connecting the hydraulic system on the right leg of the main landing gear with the center hydraulic system, which initiated the occurrence.2. Open C829 BAT BUS DISTR circuit breaker in the power supply circuit of the alternate landing gear extension system in the situation when the center hydraulic system was inoperative.3. The crews failure to detect the open C829 circuit breaker during approach to landing, after detecting that the landing gear could not be extended with the alternate system.Factors contributing to the occurrence were as follow1. Lack of guards protecting the circuit breakers on P6-1 panel against inadvertent mechanical opening; from 863 production line the guards have been mounted in the manufacturing process (SP-LPC was 659 production line).2. C829 location on panel P6-1 (extremely low position), impeding observation of its setting and favoring its inadvertent mechanical opening.3.

The left wing dropped.At 0846 the aircraft began to flare at a height of 15 feet above the runway and a speed of 155 kts (Vapp target = 138 kts).The aircraft then touched down with the main landing gear hitting the runway with a vertical load factor of 2.66 g. The longitudinal attitude is + 3.5 ° with a 2.5° roll to the right and a descent rate of about -800 ft/min.Causes (translated from French)Hard landing resulting from excessive vertical speed during touch down due to- pitch up command close to touch down (25 and 20 ft radio altitude);- a late flare at a radio altitude of about 15 ft;- an excessive indicated airspeed (Vapp + 17 kt during touchdown) and therefore a high rate of descent.The high workload of the Pilot Flying caused by manual flying under conditions of high turbulent winds and the absence of announcement of interruption of the approach by the Pilot Monitoring despite the existence of objective unstabilized approach criteria after the passage of 200 ft did not allow the crew to make the decision to discontinue the approach.",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2011

Both the pilot and a single passenger survived the accident with minor injuries.Prior to the flight, the pilot fueled the airplane with 16 gallons of jet fuel. He planned on making two local flights carrying skydivers aloft. During the second skydiving flight he delayed releasing the skydivers due to traffic in the area. As he turned the plane back towards the drop zone the airplane's engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot signalled the skydivers to exit the airplane, feathered the propeller, and executed an attempted forced landing to the runway.

The aircraft and crew were assigned or attached to the 318th Special Operations Squadron, 27th Special Operations Wing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and were deployed to the 318th Expeditionary Special Operations Squadron at Kandahar Air Base, Afghanistan.After an uneventful stop at Qalat to onload four passengers and their bags, the crew flew a 20-minute leg to Walan Rabat. Surface winds at Walan Rabat were 190 degrees at 14 knots gusting to 17 knots, 30 degrees off a direct tailwind for runway 34. Because the landing zone has a three percent upslope for runway 34, and a 1,500-foot mountain exists 1,5 miles to the north, the pilot elected to land with a tailwind on runway 34, the preferred landing direction.Walan Rabat Landing Zone is a 1,756-foot long, 31-foot wide, semi-prepared dirt strip with poorly defined boundaries. The landing zone was marked with AMP-3 markings, commonly called a ""box-and-one"" with colored panels. The pilot consulted a wind component chart and incorrectly calculated the tailwind component, mistakenly believing it was within the allowable limit for landing the M-28. The pilot flew a shallow 2,5-3 degree approach due to the upsloping landing zone. At approximately 1,000 feet short of the landing zone, the pilot visually acquired the AMP-3 markings and landed the aircraft at 1032 UTC. After a firmer than normal landing, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the prepared surface.The nose gear encountered uneven terrain and collapsed, causing the aircraft to flip tailover-nose. The crew and passengers then egressed the aircraft through the copilots window. There were no serious injuries to crew or passengers.CONCLUSIONThe AIB president found no clear and convincing evidence of the primary cause of the accident. He determined by a preponderance of evidence that the Landing Zone Condition, CrossMonitoring Performance, Task/Mission-in-Progress Re-planning, Landing with an Excessive Tailwind, and Aircraft Engine Anomalies substantially contributed to the mishap, ultimately causing the mishap aircraft to veer off the prepared surface into rough terrain, resulting in the collapse of the nose landing gear and destruction of the aircraft.18-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-201118-12-2011",Military,USAF AIB ,2011

There were 131 passengers and six crew members on board on board. Several passengers were injured in the evacuation.Sriwijaya Air flight SJ230 had departed from Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK) at 1400 on a regular flight to Yogyakarta (JOG). Weather was below minima for landing so the flight entered a holding pattern. After the second holding, the weather deteriorated, the airport authority decided to close the airport for takeoff andlanding. Following this situation, the pilot decided to divert to Surabaya-Juanda Airport. The flight to Surabaya was uneventful and the flight arrived at Surabaya at 15.40.The aircraft refuelled at Surabaya while the pilot waiting for the weather improvement at Yogyakarta.During transit in Surabaya one passenger came to the front of the cabin and expressed his disappointment of the pilot decision to divert to Surabaya. He stated that his trip Yogyakarta was to attend his father funeral and because of the delay arrival to Yogyakarta, he might have missed the funeral. The passenger then returned to his seat then afterward, the crewmember noticed that there was changing in the captain behaviour.Visibility at Yogyakarta improved to 2 km and the aircraft departed at 16.20. The pilot in command acted as pilot flying. The flight was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 09. At about 1200 ft, the pilot reported that the runway was in sight. The Adisutjipto Tower controller gave clearance to land and informed that the weather was slight rain, runway was wet and the wind was calm.The pilot realized that the aircraft was not aligned with the runway and above the glide slope, because the four Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) lights were all white. The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded with several ""pull up"" warnings. The pilot flying also commanded to select the auto brake to position four.On short final the flight path was managed to return to the normal glide path. During approach the pilot monitoring did not perform standard call out nor reminded the pilot flying of the condition of approach.After touchdown, the pilot flying activated the thrust reversers. The crew did not feel any deceleration. Prior to the end of the runway, the pilot flying noticed that the aircraft would not be able to stop in the runway and decided to turn the aircraft to the left. The aircraft stopped at 75 meter from the end of runway 09 and 54 meter on the left side of the centre line.

The airplane was operated by Swiftair under an ACMI arrangement with Gryphon Airlines. Flight SWT094 departed Dubai Airport (DXB) at 0608 local time on a scheduled service to Kandahar with the first officer as pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Kandahar approach cleared them for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 05, providing a direct vector to the FALOD Initial Approach Fix and to descend to 6000 ft.Runway in use was runway 05, and wind was reported from 060° at 17 kt gusting to 24 kt, visibility 1200 m, scattered clouds at 2700 ft and broken clouds at 3000 ft, temperature 1°C, dewpoint -7°C and QNH 1018 mbar. The target speed associated with a landing weight of 136,000 lb was estimated at 140 KIAS (Vref 135 +5). At a radio altitude of 1000 feet the airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps 40 and landing gear down. The heading was within margins but the speed was 192 kts. It should have been between Vref (135 knots) and Vref+20 (155 knots). Also, the airplane was above the theoretical glide slope. It was also descending at a rate well in excess of 1000 ft/min. The approach was not stabilized at this point.Since the captain had more operational experience at the Kandahar, he decided to take over the controls and fly the last phase of the approach. The PAPI was out of service, meaning they only had visual references to the runway and above the ground during the final part of the approach.During short final the captain corrected a deviation from the runway centerline by adjusting the flight path from right to left. During the flare, the crew noticed the airplane was shifting to the left, threatening to take them off the runway, as a result of which the captain applied a +20° right bank angle at a +9° pitch angle. This caused the right wing tip to strike the ground before the wheels made contact with the ground.Touchdown speed was 122 knots, which was below Vref as well as the target speed .The captain regarded the maneuver as a hard landing, although the first officer thought they might have struck the runway. On exiting the runway, the airport control tower ordered the crew to stop and informed them of the damage they experienced.The wing had contacted the ground some 20 m prior to the threshold, resulting in five threshold lights being destroyed by the aircraft.CAUSESThe accident was likely caused by the failure to observe the company's operating procedures and not executing a go-around when the approach was clearly not stabilized.Moreover, the operator lacked the authorization (and the crew the training) to carry out the RNAV (GPS) approach maneuver that was conducted at RWY 05 of the Kandahar Airport.Contributing to the accident was- The inoperable status of the PAPI at runway 05 of the Kandahar Airport, which was thus unable to aid the crew to establish the aircraft on the correct descent slope.24-01-201224-01-2012",International Scheduled Passenger,CIAIAC ,2012

The aircraft was then allocated a heading of 220°M, cleared to intercept the localiser and, once established, to descend on the glidepath. The PF realised that the aircraft would be high and configured the aircraft with flap 2 and the landing gear down, to capture the 3° glideslope from above. He armed the localiser mode and then attempted to arm the approach mode but inadvertently selected the EXPED pushbutton. The expedite climb mode engaged but, to prevent a climb or any mode confusion and to regain the correct profile, the PF disconnected the autopilot and the autothrust. The aircraft passed through the localiser and ATC issued a revised heading to enable the aircraft to intercept from the south. The PF decided to continue flying the approach manually and the aircraft was established on the localiser at 5.5 nm. It was configured for landing, with full flap, at 5 nm. Landing clearance was issued, with a reported surface wind of 320°/15 kt. A subsequent wind check of 320°/16 kt was broadcast three minutes before touchdown. The wind conditions were gusty and gave rise to some turbulence on the approach. Stabilised approach criteria were met at 1,000 ft and 500 ft radio altitude (RA). The VAPP (final approach) speed was 129 kt and at 50 ft RA the approach remained stable. Just below 50 ft there was a small nose-up pitch input followed by two nose-down inputs and, below 50 ft, the flight data indicated an increasing rate of descent from about 600 fpm to about 850 fpm. The data also showed that, below 100 ft RA, there were some left and right roll control inputs. Below 30 ft, over the runway, both pilots sensed that the aircraft was sinking rapidly and both initiated a TOGA 10 go-around. The PF momentarily retarded the thrust levers to idle before advancing them to the TOGA (Takeoff and Go-around) position. At the same time, he made a full forward sidestick input, within one second, which was then rapidly reversed to full aft sidestick. As the PF made the forward sidestick input, the commander initiated an aft sidestick input which reached the full aft position within one second. He followed through the PF, pushing the thrust levers fully forward and announced ""I HAVE CONTROL"". The aircraft made firm contact with the runway at 2.99g and a 12.5 ft/sec rate of descent. It touched down on all three landing gear legs simultaneously, before lifting off and starting to climb. During this phase the PF relinquished control and reverted to the PNF role.The commander remained as the PF, completed the go-around and subsequently carried out an uneventful landing on the same runway. There were no reported injuries.CONCLUSION ""Both pilots responded to an increased rate of descent approaching touchdown and each initiated a TOGA 10 go-around.  Their initial sidestick inputs were in opposition and, without the use of the takeover sidestick pushbutton, the net effect was a pitch-down control input.  If the commander had operated the sidestick takeover pushbutton, his nose-up pitch input would not have been counteracted by the nose-down input of the Capt U/T. In the event, his control input reduced the effect of the nose-down input made by the Capt U/T.""",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2012

During the takeoff just prior to the aircraft becoming airborne, the Loadmaster, who was seated in the rear of the cargo compartment, heard an electrical buzzing sound and observed an orange jet-like flame shoot across the cargo ramp from left to right at floor level. He then unbuckled his harness and was reaching for the fire extinguisher when an expansive orange fireball erupted, causing him to protect his head with his jacket. Once the fireball receded, he proceeded forward and alerted the crew to the fire while calling for the takeoff to be aborted.Concurrently, the aircraft had just become airborne and reached 10 feet above the runway. With sufficient runway remaining, the Flying Pilot landed straight ahead and aggressively stopped the aircraft while the Non-Flying Pilot notified ATC. Once the engines were shut down, all nine crewmembers quickly egressed and moved upwind of the aircraft. Crash, Fire, and Rescue services responded and expeditiously extinguished the fire. The aircraft was extensively damaged and one crewmember received a minor injury during egress.Cause Factors1. The fire was ignited due to an electrical arcing event that occurred between the auxiliary hydraulic system pump motor power supply wire harness and a pressurized auxiliary hydraulic stainless steel braided flex hose installed as part of modification CF-378.  The stainless steel braided flex hose chafed through the electrical insulation of the wire and the subsequent electrical arcing from the wire resulted in a 2mm hole in the flex hose, leak of high pressure hydraulic fluid and ignition of the hydraulic fluid. 2. The CF-378 modification leaflet did not specify sufficient routing and clamping arrangements to maintain separation of the pressurized hydraulic lines from support structure and the hydraulic pump motor wire and the re-issued CF-378 modification leaflet was ambiguous as to the correct location of the test connection support bracket. 3. The approval process for the MPP was deficient in that it did not detect the improper location of the ground test connection bracket, did not adequately consider the effect of the redesign on routing and clamping, did not treat the revised configuration as a new modification, and did not specify the application of the MPP installed alternate parts in the amended parts list. 4. The modification approval process did not contain specific provisions to consider impacts of routing and clamping for wiring hoses IAW CFTOs C-17-010-002/ME-001, Aircraft Electrical and Electronic Wiring and for flexible hoses IAW CFTO C-12-010-040/TR-010, Part 3 Aircraft Flexible Hose Standard Manufacture, Replacement and Inspection. 5.

The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries.The airplane took off from runway 29 on a ferry flight to Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, AM (MAO). It failed to gain enough height on takeoff and collided with a pole. The airplane came down in a wooded area just off Avenida Torquato Tapajós.Manaus-Aeroclube de Flores Airport, AM has a single, 860 m long asphalt runway.It appeared that the control locks were still in place and had not been removed during the preflight checks.Individual informationa) Attitude - unspecifiedTo assume all the responsibilities of flight (flight notification, removal from the aircraft, inspections, etc.) almost alone, the pilot showed overconfidence in his ability to perform such a task, possibly considering it ordinary and of low complexity.In addition, the company mechanic's participation in the preparation of the aircraft may have strengthened the confidence that the pre-flight items that may pass unnoticed would be performed by one technician.b) Memory - contributedThe pilot forgot the control lock on the aircraft, which may have resulted from the rush to do the checklist, in which some items were not checked properly, as the existing lock model, which was less visible and was not approved for aeronautical purposes.c) Motivation - contributedThe commander proved to be very motivated to make the supply flight quickly, so as not to impair the subsequent flight, which may have interfered with the completion of the checklist so that culminated in lock remaining in place.Information Psychosociala) Team Dynamics - contributedAlthough the pilot relied on mechanical help in the preparation of the aircraft, the dynamic established by them did not guarantee the execution of the tasks efficiently and safely.Organizational Informationa) Organizational culture - contributedThe company since two years used a non-approved control lock and there was no standardization of the procedures of company manuals, which indicates that the fragile safety culture that reverberated in the accident.b) Support Systems - contributedThe manuals of the company not clearly specified the activities that the mechanic should follow when preparing the aircraft, thus allowing gaps were created in the execution of the task.Concerning aircraft operationa) Cockpit coordination - contributedThe pilot in command stopped using organizational resources available to him to accomplish the task to transfer the aircraft. The copilot had not arrived and the mechanic of the company was not among its duties to perform the complete pre-flight aircraft. Thus, the commander had to perform various tasks in a relatively short time and, therefore, failed to comply with an important item in the checklist that was removal of the lock of flight controls.b) Pilot forgetfulness - contributedThe pilot forgot to remove the control lock during inspections (internal and external). Also forgot to perform the checklist of items relating to freedom of controls (aileron and elevator), during taxi the aircraft. The realization of these checks during pre-flight or even in the taxi the aircraft would have avoided the takeoff and, therefore, the accident.c) Managerial supervision - contributedInadequate supervision of maintenance management allowed the aircraft involved in the accident to possess control locks not certified as an aeronautical product.d) Non-standard procedure - contributedThe pilot, possibly due to the rush to perform takeoff, failed to meet a number of items set out in checklist that, if realized, would alert the commands that the lock had not been removed. This item can be considered as the last barrier to prevent the accident.28-02-2012",Ferry/positioning,CENIPA ,2012

There were no injuries.Flight NM309 had departed Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA), UK on a flight to Ronaldsway Airport (IOM). The flight had been routine and the crew were flying a day, visual approach to runway 26, in good weather, with the surface wind reported as 210° at 14 kt. The commander was the pilot flying (PF) and the co-pilot, who had recently joined the company, was nearing the end of his line training on type. The approach was flown with full flap and the gear locked and confirmed down by the three green gear indicators. The landing weight was estimated to be 13,448 lb (6,099 kg) and the crew recalled that the Vref was about 105 kt. Almost immediately the aircraft touched down it leaned to the right and there was an unusual noise. The commander levelled the aircraft with a left roll input. However, as the speed decayed the lean increased and it became apparent that there was a problem with the right gear. The commander continued to apply left aileron and rudder. Both pilots recognised that the aircraft was likely to leave the paved surface and so the co-pilot held the control wheel and rudder to allow the commander to apply nosewheel steering and operate the feather levers. The left engine was shut down and feathered as the aircraft departed the runway. The right engine was also shut down but its propeller did not feather as the mechanism appears to have been damaged when the blades contacted the runway. The aircraft left the paved surface, yawed to the right and slid sideways before it came to a stop 90° to the runway heading.The right landing gear failed as a result of intergranular corrosion / stress corrosion cracking of the forward yoke pintle.This same aircraft (Jetstream 31 msn 785) suffered a failure of the left hand main landing gear while landing at Doncaster/Sheffield-Robin Hood Airport (DCA), U.K., August 15, 2014.PROBABLE CAUSE The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.08-03-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2012

Both pilots were killed.The airplane took off from runway 10 at San Juan-Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport bound for Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM). It carried 12100 pounds of cargo mainly consisting of bread. Shortly after takeoff the captain declared an emergency, stating that they wanted to return to the airport. They reported smoke coming from one of the engines. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 10, but the crew requested runway 28 for landing. This was approved and the controller cleared N153JR to land, stating that the wind was ""150 at 3"".The flight came down in the Torrecilla Lagoon on the east side of the airport. It sank in 30-50 feet of water.Investigation showed that the estimated ramp weight of the airplane was 47,710 lbs. The Convair CV-440s maximum allowable takeoff weight of 48,000 lbs requires use of both the antidetonation injection and autofeather systems; however, because neither system was used on the accident flight, the maximum allowable takeoff weight was 40,900 lbs.Flight crew injuries were consistent with the first officer flying the airplane at the time of impact; however, considering the first officers limited recent experience in the Convair CV-440 and the performance deficiencies identified in his training and certification history, he was likely not capable of handling the emergency without help from the captain.The captain on the other hand was likely suffering from acute sleep loss at the time of the accident, which would have negatively affected his ability to guide the first officer in properly handling the emergency.Probable Cause ""The flight crew's failure to maintain adequate airspeed after shutting down the right engine due to an in-flight fire in one of the right augmentors.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada.The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River.Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather.Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River.The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF).During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight.The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank.During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Although the hazardous runway condition had been identified by the company's safety management system, the delay in action to mark the runway allowed this condition to persist.2. Up-to-date weather and runway condition information was not provided to the crew, nor was it requested by the crew.3. The pilot continued the approach below the visibility limits specified in the company's standard operating procedures.4. Deteriorating weather, as well as the lack of approach aids and runway markings, hampered the pilot's ability to establish the aircraft onto a stable final approach prior to crossing the threshold.5. The company's standard operating procedures for stabilized approaches were not followed, and an unstabilized approach was allowed to continue.6. The pilot was unable to position the aircraft over the centre of the runway as it settled to land, and the left main landing gear entered the deeper snow at the runway edge, causing the aircraft to veer into the snow bank.Findings as to risk1. If a company's risk mitigation strategy is not implemented in a timely manner, hazards are allowed to persist, increasing the risk of an accident.2. If company standard operating procedures do not include criteria and procedures for stabilized approaches, or they are not followed, there is an increased risk of landing accidents.3. Operating on a snow-covered runway that does not have markings or devices to allow a pilot to easily identify the runway surface increases the risk of runway excursions.4. If the identified risks and mitigation strategies are not communicated to the people exposed to the risks, it is possible they will deem the risk as acceptable to management and continue operations.17-03-201217-03-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2012

None of the 296 passengers and 12 crew were injured.The captain on the flight was Pilot Monitoring, the co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The en route and descent parts of the flight were uneventful.The right main landing gear touched down at about 610 m from the runway 34L threshold with a pitch angle of 3.3 degrees and vertical acceleration of 1.27 G. After that, the captain gave large pitch-up and pitch-down control inputs to assist the control of the copilot, and the vertical acceleration of the aircraft fluctuated significantly twice. Due to these changes in vertical acceleration, the captain felt that the aircraft had bounced and was floating, although this was not the case. At this time the speed brakes had activated and the reverse thrust was being applied, but the captain did not notice this. The captain diverted his attention to look outside of the aircraft to confirm its attitude, and then judged to make a go-around. When he noticed that the reversers had been activated, he still decided to continue the go around, although the AOM calls for a full stop landing when reversers have been activated. The captain called for a go around three times but the TO/GA switch could not be activated by the co-pilot because the reversers were selected. The captain then called ""I have control"" and took over controls. All the time the airplane had been rolling on the runway in a nose up attitude, causing a tailstrike. The go around was continued and the airplane landed safely at 1635.PROBABLE CAUSE ""In this accident, it is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude after touchdown, causing the aft fuselage to come into contact with the runway and be damaged.It is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude due to the following reasons after touchdown, the PIC had felt that the Aircraft had bounced to the extent necessary for go-around, and judged to make go-around to avoid a hard landing; even after he became aware that the reverse thrust levers had been raised, he continued go-around; hence, it tooktime for the engine thrust to increase and he continued to pull his control column. Moreover, it is somewhat likely that, in a situation in which the PIC had been assisting the control of the FO, and without the PICs declaring a takeover, the intention of the PIC was not properly conveyed to the FO, the sharing of duties between PF and PM became momentarily unclear, and the monitoring of flight information such as pitch angle and speed, which was the duty of PM, was not performed adequately.""",International Scheduled Passenger,JTSB ,2012
02-APR-2012,ATR 72-201,VP-BYZ,UTair Aviation,33,near Tyumen Airpo...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20120402-0,Initial climb (ICL),Destroyed,Icing,"An ATR-72 passenger plane was destroyed in an accident shortly after takeoff from Tyumen Airport (TJM), Russia. According to the airline, UTair, there were 39 passengers and four crew members on board. The Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that 12 passengers sustained serious injuries. One of the survivors died on April 12, another one on April 19.Flight 120 took off from Tyumen Airport runway 21 on a regular domestic passenger flight to Surgut (SGC). The ATR-72 climbed to a height of 210 m and then banked 35° left, followed by a 50° right hand bank. It then struck a snowy field approx. 1,6 km past the end of the runway, broke up and a fire erupted.The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that both engines were working properly at the time of the accident. The Federal Air Transport Agency reported that the airplane had been parked outside for eight hours in weather conditions which included snow and temperatures at and just below freezing level. The airplane was not de-iced prior to departure and the crew did not insist on being de-iced.CausesThe immediate cause of the ATR 72-201 VP-BYZ aircraft accident was the PIC's decision to takeoff without de/anti-icing treatment despite the fact that snow and ice deposits were present on aircraft surface and were discovered by the crew members during taxi which resulted in degradation of aircraft aerodynamic performance and stall during climbing after takeoff as well as inability of the crew to recognize stall and, consequently, failure to undertake recovery procedure.The aircraft stall occurred at the operational angles of attack right after flaps retraction with engaged autopilot before stall warning system activation and was caused by the loss of the wing lift effectiveness due to takeoff with non-removed ground icing.The system cause of the accident were shortcomings in ground handling activities and staff training in UTAir-Technik that became possible because of absence of due monitoring by the Technical and Operation Supervising Directorates of UTAir airline for compliance with airline requirements regarding ground handling and aircraft ground icing protection which resulted in erroneous evaluation of aircraft conditions by the PIC and aircraft mechanic (the shift head kept himself aloof from monitoring mechanic's activities) after the aircraft has been on ground in icing conditions for a long time and in release the aircraft to fly without de/anti-icing treatment.The contributing factors were- The shortcomings in the UTAir safety management system, which contains, all in all, general issues only and is not adopted for the implementation of Airline activities in particular areas, which did not allow to reveal and correct existing safety risks in a timely manner.- The shortcomings in the UTAir-Technic quality management system, resulted in neglecting of certain requirements of the UTAir ground handling management manual regarding staff training and monitoring for aircraft de/anti-icing treatment which led to the situation when not sufficiently-qualified staff performed the evaluation of the aircraft surface conditions and made the decision on need for the aircraft to be de-iced/anti-iced.- The absence at the time of the accident of basic regulations in force that establish state requirements for ground handling (de/anti-icing treatment in particular) including staff training and organization licensing.- The shortcomings in crewmembers initial and recurrent training as far as the danger of ground icing, its influence on the aircraft aerodynamic performance together with aircraft anti-icing system operation features and design are concerned that did not allow the crew to make the only appropriate decision to return for de-icing/anti-icing treatment after the observation of the snow and ice contamination on the wing after anti-icing system activation in de-icing mode while taxiing for takeoff.- The methodological imperfection of the crew computer based and simulator training programs concerning the prevention of aircraft stall, identification of approach to stall and taking timely actions for recovery.- The increasing need for number of flight crews to perform highly growing flights schedule which, with ineffective SMS, resulted in flight instructor work deficiencies during PIC training and absence of PIC skills to take correct decisions and to strictly comply with the regulations in force.- The possible fatigue of the crew members due to the violation of the work and rest balance while performing split flight shifts together with a large number of unused days-off.02-04-201202-04-201202-04-201202-04-201202-04-201202-04-201202-04-201220 OCT 1992F-WWLNATR08 JAN 1993B-22710Transasia Airways01 JAN 1999OH-KRLFinnair23 NOV 2003OH-KRLAero Airlines26 AUG 2005ES-KRLAero Airlines06 JAN 2008ES-KRLAero Airlines23 JUL 2008VP-BYZUTAir",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2012

They were then scheduled to return, with passengers, to London-Gatwick Airport (LGW).An onboard hand-held Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) HP iPAQ computer was used to calculate the takeoff performance data. Once this was completed, the EFB was placed in the standby mode. The flightto Chambery was uneventful and the aircraft landed at 0915, 15 minutes behind schedule.The return flight to Gatwick was scheduled to depart at 1000. The pre-flight preparations proceeded normally and the pilots reported no distractions other than those normally experienced during a turnaround. The co-pilot, who was the non-handling pilot for this flight, completed the manual load sheet whilst the commander programmed the route into the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The commander reported that he then cross-checked the load sheet information and, having ensured it was correct, entered the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) into the FMC. The FMC then calculated the Takeoff Weight (TOW) using the fuel weight automatically retained in the system. The commander read back the FMC calculated TOW to the co-pilot, who cross-checked it against the load sheet data and confirmed that they agreed.Having loaded the ZFW into the FMC and cross-checked the TOW, the commander used the EFB computer to calculate the takeoff performance data. This involved waking up the EFB from the standby mode, then entering the airfield, weather and aircraft data, which included the flap position for takeoff. A specific flap setting could be entered, or the computer could be used to provide an optimum setting. The commander stated that he normally entered Flap 5 for the takeoff performance calculation. However, at airports where performance was considered to be more critical, he would set the performance computer to select the optimum setting. As the runway at Chambery is relatively short, the commander chose the optimum flap position calculated by the performance computer. This gave a selection of Flap 1 which, under the circumstances, he did not consider unusual. Similarly, the computed takeoff speeds did not seem unusual to the commander, particularly as they were predicated on a flap setting he did not normally use.The computed figures, based on the data entered on the EFB, allowed for a reduced thrust takeoff. The calculated assumed temperature to be set to achieve this did not seem unreasonable at the time, although the commander stated that, in hindsight, he considered it to be too high for the airfield and the prevailing conditions.Both pilots stated that they would normally cross-check the performance figures once they had been calculated on the EFB. However, on this occasion, and for reasons the pilots could not recall, this was not done. The commander wrote the speeds he had computed using the EFB on the flight paperwork and then entered them into the FMC, overwriting the FMC generated speeds. The commander stated that this was standard practice and on this occasion he did not take note of any difference between the two sets of speeds. The rest of the pre-flight preparation was completed and the aircraft took off from runway 36 at Chambery at 1008 UTC (1208 local time), on schedule, with 131 passengers onboard. The pilots reported the weather at the time was good, with a light wind from the east, good visibility and dry conditions. The ATIS reported a temperature of 8°C and a QNH of 999 hPa.On takeoff both pilots felt a slight judder, which they considered was due to turbulence from the preceding aircraft. Early in the climb they received a call on the intercom from the rear cabin station informing them that the cabin crew to the rear of the aircraft had also felt a judder. This call was intended for the cabin purser at the front of the cabin, but was mistakenly made to the flight deck. The pilots reassured the cabin crew member, still believing the judder was due to turbulence. Their opinion was reinforced by the absence of any abnormal flight deck indications or calls from ATC at Chambery to the contrary.The remainder of the flight went without incident and the aircraft landed at Gatwick at 1130. The aircraft was taxied to stand and, after shutting down, the pilots were informed by ground personnel that the underside of the rear fuselage had sustained damage consistent with a tailstrike. This prompted the crew to reconsider the cause of the judder felt at takeoff and they reviewed the takeoff performance data. This revealed that the commander had omitted to enter the aircraft's TOW into the EFB computer at Chambery, with the result that the computer had reverted to the previous TOW data retained from Stansted to calculate the takeoff performance figures.14-04-2012",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2012

20-APR-2012,Boeing 737-236A,AP-BKC,Bhoja Airlines,127,near Islamabad-Be...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20120420-0,Approach (APR),Destroyed,Windshear/downdraft Loss of control,"A Boeing 737-236 passenger plane, operated by Bhoja Airlines, was destroyed in an accident near Islamabad, Pakistan. All 121 passengers and six crew members were killed. Bhoja Airlines flight 213 departed Karachi (KHI) at 1705 on a domestic flight to Islamabad (ISB). This was the inaugural evening flight for the airline on this route.The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL310 and continued towards Islamabad. Weather at the destination was poor due to a passing thunderstorm. At 1819 the captain at a distance observed the squall line. Moments later the flight was cleared to descend to FL200. During the descent the captain and first officer discussed the weather. They were worried about the severity of the thunderstorm ahead.At 1826 the first officer contacted Islamabad Approach and received clearance for the One Foxtrot arrival for an ILS approach to runway 30. After receiving further descent clearance the first officer discussed opportunities to approach the airfield through a gap in the squall line. The Approach controller gave radar vectors and descent instructions to fly through the gap in the storm.At 1835, Islamabad Approach gave a weather update and said ""Bhoja 213 surface wind at Islamabad ah is varying between 180° to 270°, 10 kts and ah sometimes gusting to 20 kts and runway condition is wet, light drizzle is ah uhm going on, braking action not known"".Two minutes later the airplane entered the squall line. Although the Bhoja Air Operational Manual prohibited flight in these conditions, the captain decided to continue. The airplane was configured for the approach with flaps and slats selected and the undercarriage was down. The first officer then reported the speed to be 220 knots, which was 30 knots higher than the recommended speed. The captain reacted surprised as he did not expect this because the he was flying with the auto-throttle engaged. Likely the increase in speed was a result of windshear. The aircraft then entered the active weather cell with precipitation continuing in varying intensity. At 1839 the airplane captured the ILS and descended on the glide slope. At this point the aircraft should have been in landing configuration with flaps at 30°. However, only flaps 5 were selected. The aircraft then encountered an increasing downdraft. The pitch attitude increased and computed airspeed decreased as the autopilot attempted to maintain the glide slope. The GPWS consequently sounded with the aural alarm ""Wind shear - Wind shear - Wind shear"". Although the first officer anxiously called for a go around, no action was taken.The downdraft dissipated and the pitch attitude decreased but the aircraft deviated left of the extended runway centerline, and was brought back by the captain. At that moment the autopilot disconnected due to the aircraft deviation beyond the autopilot maximum authority limits. The auto throttle remained engaged in IAS speed mode. Following autopilot disconnect, there was no control wheel activity recorded for approximately 6 seconds and no control column activity for approximately 8 seconds. The crew were likely confused. During this period of control inactivity, the aircraft deviated below the glide slope. Then the Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) alarm sounded ""Whoop, Whoop, Whoop"". No action was taken by either crew member. A few seconds later the aircraft entered another downdraft and the rate of descent increased rapidly. The TAWS alarm sounded again, directing the crew to ""pull up"". The captain responded with a nose-up column input. However, pressure altitude and thrust continued to decrease. The downdraft dissipated rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in angle of attack of the aircraft, which activated the stick shaker for almost 2 seconds. It appeared that captain lowered the nose down to get out of stick shaker regime however, proper and complete Boeing recommended stall and recovery procedures were not carried out. This resulted in a 12° nose down pitch. Then another windshear alarm sounded, followed by another stick shaker activation. The first officer shouted to ""get out"" and ""go around"" but the attempts by the captain failed as he did not apply the proper procedures to execute a go around.Shortly after initial ground contact, the aircraft struck a steeply sloped terrace about 5 meters high which resulted in significant structural breakup of the aircraft structure.The ineffective automated flight deck management in extreme adverse weather conditions by cockpit crew caused the accident. The ineffective automated flight deck management was due to various factors including; incorrect selection of cockpit crew on account of their inadequate flying experience, training and competence level for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series), absence of formal simulator training in respect of FO for handling an automated flight deck, non-existence of cockpit crew professional competence / skill level monitoring system at operator level (Bhoja Air).The cockpit crew incorrect decision to continue the flight for destination and non-adherence to Boeing recommended QRH and FCOM remedial actions /procedures due to non-availability of customized aircraft documents (at Bhoja Air) for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series) contributed towards the causation of accident. The inability of CAA Pakistan to ensure automated flight deck variance type training and monitoring requirements primarily due to incorrect information provided by the Bhoja Air Management was also a contributory factor in causation of the accident.20-04-201220-04-201213 DEC 1984G-BKYIBoeing07 JAN 1985G-BKYIBritish Airways06 JUN 1999ZS-OLBComairJAN 2011ZS-OLBComairFEB 2012AP-BKCBhoja Airlines",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CAA Pakistan ,2012

There were no injuries.The airplane operated on a ferry flight from Madina (MED), Saudi Arabia carrying ten crew members.The visibility at Jeddah was good with a few clouds present. During the initial ILS approach to runway 16R, while at 8 nautical miles and 2600 feet, the landing gear handle was lowered. Both main landing gears extended and locked down and, the nose gear doors opened but the nose landing gear did not lower. The captain who was then the Pilot Monitoring (PM) took over the controls and carried out a missed approach.The First Officer (FO) became the Pilot Monitoring (PM). SVA 2865 was then given an area to the northeast of Jeddah to carry out attempts at lowering the nose gear.The flight crew attempted to manually free fall the nose landing gear at least ten times. The nose landing gear would not lower into the locked position, but the nose gear doors remained open during all those attempts.As a precautionary measure, SVA 2865 performed a fly-by of runway 16R at 500 ft. The air traffic controller confirmed that the nose landing gear was not down.SVA 2865 was vectored over the Red Sea to lower the fuel load, thus reducing the landing weight. During this period, the Fire & Rescue Services (FRS) at Jeddah foamed a portion of runway 16L between taxiway Kilo 5 (K5) and K2. SVA 2865 was vectored for an instrument approach for runway 16L. The Auto Pilot and the Auto Throttle Systems were OFF. The surface winds were from 220° at 12 knots (kt), gusting to 19 kt and the temperature was +37 Celsius (°C).The flight crew used the ""Landing with Nose Landing Gear Abnormal"" checklist ensuring the aircraft was properly prepared and configured for the approach, the before landing, the flare and the touchdown sequences, including when the aircraft stopped and the necessary procedures to secure the aircraft before evacuation.The aircraft landed on its main landing gear 4000 ft past the threshold of runway 16L. The nose of the aircraft was slowly lowered to the runway with the nose landing gear doors touching the runway within the foamed area 4500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The front of the fuselage then touched the runway within the last portion of foam, 3500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The nose area of the aircraft slid on the runway, where sparks were present until the aircraft came to a full stop 1500 ft prior to the end of runway 16L. There was no fire.Cause Related Findings1. The NLG up-lock contained a spring, Part Number GA71102 that was broken as a result of fatigue initiated at the third coil of the spring.2. The spring had been broken for a prolonged period of time, as noted by the spring linear wear marks on the outside area of the spring coils.3. Damage observed on the NLG up-lock resulted from hard contact with the broken spring during normal NLG operation.4. The fracture process of the spring was initiated at the third coil level. At least 6000 cycles of fatigue (number of striations) have been estimated by fatigue striation measurements. The crack on the spring started on the internal surface of the spring which was not shot peened.5. The normal and free fall extensions of the NLG failed due to a mechanical blockage created by the broken spring jammed against the cam.01-05-201201-05-201201-05-2012",Ferry/positioning,,2012

All 45 on board were killed. A flight plan had been filed for an IFR flight from Halim Airport to Pelabuhan Ratu area then return to Halim Airport. The flight departed Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH) at 1421. It flew south and circled Mount Salak (elevation 7254 feet). After circling the mountain, the airplane began to descend from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet. Last contact with the flight was at 1430. The wreckage was found the following morning on a near-vertical mountainside on the eastern side of Mount Salak at an elevation of 6,100 feet. The Superjet was conducting a demonstration flight to prospective customers in several countries. Demonstrations were flown in Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan before arriving in Indonesia on May 9. Two demonstration flights were planned. The first flight was uneventful. Passengers on the second flight were reporters and representatives of several Indonesian airlines. There were six crew members on board, two representatives of Sukhoi and 37 journalists and prospective clients.FACTORSa. The crew were not aware of the mountainous area surrounding the flight path due to various factors resulting in disregarding the TAWS warning. b. The Jakarta Radar service had not established the minimum vectoring altitudes and the system was not equipped with functioning MSAW for the particular area surrounding Mount Salak. c. Distraction to the flight crew from prolonged conversation not related to the progress of the flight resulted in the pilot flying did not continue to change the aircraft heading while in orbit. Consequently, the aircraft unintentionally exited the orbit.09-05-201209-05-201209-05-201209-05-2012",Demonstration,NTSC Indonesia ,2012

It was a regular public transport flight that had been planned to refuel at Sasereme and continue to Balimo and on to Daru. For the flight to Sasereme, the pilot in command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot, and the copilot was the handling pilot. The aircraft arrived over the Saserema airstrip at 0240. While en-route, the crew was informed by the company flight operations staff that it had been raining at Sasereme throughout the previous night until morning, but the prevailing weather was fine.The flight was being conducted under the visual flight rules (VFR) procedures. The copilot had not flown into Sasereme before, so this was a training flight for her. During the cruise before top of descent, the crew discussed the approach and landing requirements. Because of the wet, slippery and rough airstrip surface conditions and a landing weight of 5,300 kg, they agreed on a 30 degrees flap settings and a approach speed of 73 knots.The weather, as observed by the crew, was sunny and fine with few clouds around and the wind was estimated to be light and variable (2 to 3 kt) even though there was no wind sock available to indicate the actual wind velocity. The crew opted to land on strip 14 and joined the circuit on left downwind.Passing through 50 ft the copilot flared the aircraft and it floated in ground effect. As the main landing gear touched down on the centreline of the strip it skipped, became airborne and stayed in ground effect for at least another 20 m. On the second touchdown the aircraft yawed to the left and at that point the PIC took over the controls and applied full reverse thrust. He applied right rudder to regain the centreline, but at the same time the left main landing gear started impacting the ruts in the surface of the strip, severely degrading directional control.The PIC subsequently reported that at that point he felt it was not safe to apply power for an aborted landing. He moved the left power lever out of reverse while keeping full reverse and right rudder input on the right engine and began pulsing the brakes. The left main wheel continued impacting more ruts as the aircraft decelerated. Eventually the left main wheel hit a deep rut pulling the aircraft sharply to the left off the runway.That partially dislodged the landing gear from the airframe causing the left wing to impact the ground. The aircraft came to rest about 5 m from the edge of the airstrip. The PIC shut down the engines while the copilot assisted the passengers from aircraft through the right rear cabin door.The investigation determined that the decision to operate into Sasereme on a scheduled air service, without knowing the serviceability of the strip, was a safety deficiency in the operation of the aircraft and contributory factor in the accident.The PIC did not provide the copilot with the opportunity to observe an approach and landing at Sasereme before allowing her to handle a landing there as pilot flying.The PIC's late decision to take control of the aircraft from the copilot and execute a go-around was also a contributory factor.15-05-201215-05-201215-05-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2012

There were 58 passengers and four crew members on board. Six passengers sustained minor injuries.Lufthansa subsidiary Air Dolomiti operated flight LH1912 from Munich to Venice, Italy. The flight departed at 1334. Shortly after takeoff smoke was reported in the cabin. The captain decided to return to Munich. After receiving clearance to descend to FL110, engine power was reduced. At that time the flight crew noted a Master Caution alert and a fire warning for engine no.2. The pilots fired the extinguishing bottle in engine no.2 and proceeded to shut it down.The descent was continued while the flight crew worked the appropriate checklists.After landing on runway 26L, the ATR 72 began turning left until it ran off the side of the runway. The airplane went into the grass and came to rest with the nose gear collapsed.It was found that the engine failure was caused by a broken turbine blade in the second stage of the power turbine. The turbine blade above the root in the area of the wing had fractured due to fatigue fracture followed by residual fracture due to tensile overload.It was also found that the Travel Limiter Unit (TLU), which limits the travel of the rudder, was in high-speed mode and could only be moved to a limited extent.17-05-201217-05-201217-05-2012",International Scheduled Passenger,BFU Germany ,2012

The airline transport pilot and commercial co-pilot were not injured. The airplane was taxiing to position for takeoff from runway 8R and its intended destination was Austin, Texas.The flight crew reported that the airplane was about 60 pounds over its maximum weight for takeoff. Since their taxi to the assigned runway was long, they decided to reduce weight by using higher-than-normal engine power settings while maintaining some amount of braking to control speed while taxiing in order to burn fuel prior to takeoff. During the taxi, the right and left main landing gear tires deflated when the fusible plugs in the wheels blew out due to over-heating, and a fire ignited in the right wheel housing. The crew reported that they felt the airplane yaw as the tires deflated and were informed via radio by a following airplane that their right wheel was on fire. The crew brought the airplane to a stop on the taxiway, evacuated, and attempted to extinguish the fire with two hand-held fire extinguishers. Airport fire fighting personnel arrived on scene and extinguished the fire using foam suppressant.

The first officer was Pilot Flying.Flight DAN992 initiated engine startup at 1436, taxied to runway 04 at Abuja Airport and was later airborne at 1458. Fuel endurance was 3.5 hours. The flight climbed to a cruise altitude of 26,000 ft.DAN992 made contact with Lagos Area Control Center at 1518. At the time the captain and first officer were in a discussion of a nonnormal condition regarding the correlation between the engine throttle setting and an engine power indication. However, they did not voice concerns then that the condition would affect the continuation of the flight. The flight crew continued to monitor the condition and became increasingly concerned as the flight transition through the initial descent from cruise altitude at 1522 and the subsequent approach phase.DAN992 reported passing through 18,100 at 1530. Shortly afterwards the crew confirmed that there was no throttle response on the left engine and subsequently the Captain took over control as Pilot Flying (PF). The flight was however continued towards Lagos with no declaration of any distress message. With the confirmation of throttle response on the right engine, the engine anti-ice, ignition and bleed-air were all switched off. At 1532, the crew observed the loss of thrust in engine no. 1.Between 1537 and 1541 the flight crew were engaged in pre-landing tasks including deployment of the slats, and extension of the flaps and landing gear. At 154116 the first officer inquired, ""both engines coming up?"" and the captain replied ""negative."" The flight crew subsequently discussed and agreed to declare an emergency. At 154210, DANA 992 radioed an emergency distress call indicating ""dual engine failure...negative response from throttle.""At 154235, the flight crew lowered the flaps further and continued with the approach and discussed landing alternatively on runway 18L. At 154245, the captain reported the runway in sight and instructed the first officer to raise the flaps and 4 seconds later to raise the landing gear.At 154327 hours, the captain informed the first officer ""we just lost everything, we lost an engine. I lost both engines"". During the next 25 seconds the flight crew was attempting to restart the engines. The airplane did not reach the runway and crashed in a residential area about 9,3 km short of the runway 18R.During the impact sequence, the airplane struck an incomplete building, two trees and three buildings. The wreckage was confined, with the separated tail section and engines located at the beginning of the debris field. A fire erupted.An investigation by AIB Nigeria showed that the captain was employed by Dana Air on 14th March, 2012. He was originally from the United States, but was suspended in 2009 by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for some misdemeanours.It was noted that most of the recommendation letters submitted by the captain were also signed. Further, the line trainings that preceded the captain's checkout had a lot of adverse remarks made by the training captain.He started flying as checked out captain on 2nd May, 2012 and had accrued over 120 hours of flight time before the accident.Tear down of the engines showed that the no.1 engine was overhauled in the U.S in August 2011 and was not in compliance with Service Bulletin SB 6452. Both engines had primary and secondary fuel manifold assemblies fractured, cracked, bent, twisted or pinched which led to fuel leaks, fuel discharge to bypass duct, loss of engine thrust and obvious failure of engine responding tothrottle movement.This condition was similar to the no.1 engine of a different Dana Air MD-80, 5N-SAI, that was involved in an incident in October 2013 when the aircraft returned to the departure airport with the engine not responding th throttle movements. This engine also was not in compliance with Service Bulletin SB 6452. This bulletin was issued in 2003 and called for the installation of new secondary fuel manifold assemblies, incorporating tubes fabricated from new material which has a fatigue life that was approximately 2 times greater than the previous tube material.Probable Causal Factors1. Engine number 1 lost power seventeen minutes into the flight, and thereafter on final approach, Engine number 2 lost power and failed to respond to throttle movement on demand for increased power to sustain the aircraft in its flight configuration.2. The inappropriate omission of the use of the Checklist, and the crews inability to appreciate the severity of the power-related problem, and their subsequent failure to land at the nearest suitable airfield.3. Lack of situation awareness, inappropriate decision making, and poor airmanship.03-06-201213 NOV 1990N944ASAlaska Airlines04 NOV 2002N944ASAlaska Airlines20 AUG 2006N944ASAlaska Airlines21 AUG 2008N944ASAlaska Airlines11 SEP 2008N944ASAlaska Airlines17 FEB 20095N-RAMDana Air19 APR 20105N-RAMDana Air",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AIB Nigeria ,2012

N14447, coded ""Tanker 11"", under contract to the US Forest Service, crashed about 20 miles north of Modena, Iron County, Utah, during a fire fighting operation against the White Rock Fire in the Hamblin Valley Area.Tanker 11 departed the tanker base to conduct its second fire retardant drop of the day in the same location. Upon arriving in the fire traffic area, Tanker 11 followed the lead airplane into the drop zone, which was located in a shallow valley 0.4 mile wide and 350 feet deep. The lead airplane flew a shallow right turn onto final and then dropped to an altitude of 150 feet above the valley floor while approaching the intended drop zone. While making the right turn onto final behind the lead airplane, Tanker 11's right wing tip collided with terrain, which resulted in a rapid right yaw and subsequent impact with terrain. The wreckage created a 1,088-foot-long debris field, and a post impact fire ensued. Two witnesses took photographs of the accident sequence photos, and an examination of these photographs showed that the lead airplane was positioned ahead of the tanker throughout the flight; however, the orientation of the lead airplane compared to the orientation of Tanker 11 indicated that Tanker 11 did not directly follow the lead airplane's path to the final drop course. Rather, it was about 700 feet left of the lead airplane's path and made a wider right turn as it attempted to align with the final drop course. The accident flight crewmembers had previously flown nearly the same exact drop and the lead pilot cautioned them about tailwind conditions during the flight; however, the wider turn suggests that they did not properly compensate for the wind conditions while maneuvering. In addition, the previous flight was conducted at an altitude above the ridgeline. GPS evidence indicates that the accident flight was conducted below the ridgeline, which would have made it more difficult to detect the rising terrain during the wider turn. A review of the airplane's cockpit voice recorder audio information revealed that the flight crew did not recognize or attempt to correct the reduced clearance between Tanker 11 and the rising terrain until about 2 seconds before impact.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The flight crew's misjudgment of terrain clearance while maneuvering for an aerial application run, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to follow the lead airplane's track and to effectively compensate for the tailwind condition while maneuvering.""03-06-201203-06-2012",Fire fighting,NTSB ,2012

When on approach to Porterville, California, the main landing gear showed unsafe on port side. The pilot aborted the landing and climbed above pattern altitude where the landing gear was cycled again with same results. The left gear would not extend. A decision was made to return to the companys base at Minden-Tahoe Airport where contact was made with operations and maintenance personnel. After all emergency procedures and maintenance ideas were exhausted the pilot executed an emergency landing on runway 16 with main the left gear still in the up position. The nose and starboard gear were down and locked. After touchdown and bleeding off airspeed, the aircraft settled on the port jet pod and sustained left engine propeller strikes.

The wreckage was located on July 20, 2012 in 8 feet deep water south off Isla de Flores. Both pilots were killed.The flight took off about 1955 from runway 06 at Montevideo. While climbing to the assigned altitude of FL80 the airplane entered a left hand turn. The controller contacted the flight. The crew replied they would change course to the SARGO waypoint. This was the last contact with the flight.Probable CauseLoss of Control of the Aircraft due to being flying with erroneous indications of the flight instruments, added to the possible formation of crystalline ice on its structure, causing a loss of situational awareness of the crew.Contributing factors- Lack of Aeronautical Weather information for the area at the time of Operation.- Lack of confidence in the Meteorological Radar of the Aircraft (the PF had made several notes in the RTV about its operability).- According to the different analyses, it could be determined that the 115 Volts A.C. electrical system was not energized, so it is presumed that the checklist was not performed correctly in different procedures, which led to the avoidance of control items for the operation of navigation instruments. (The ignition control of the inverters is marked with an asterisk in the aircraft checklists, which determines that the item must be performed with the assistance of the NFP) .- The PF had made its last five flights in another aircraft (CX-CLS), in which although it is the same model as the accident, the inverters do not energize the Navigation Instruments. - The Flight Plan presented showed the CX-CLS aircraft as planned to perform the Mission.- TWR request for take-off before the time determined by the flight plan.- The taxiing was too fast, which conditioned the correct checking of the checklists for takeoff.- Not recognizing the failure of Instruments, motivated to make a turn that diverted the Aircraft from the route and directed it towards a Cloud System with Freezing conditions.- Not realizing the possible formation of crystalline ice in the structure of the aircraft, making a turn that aggravated the situation.- Possible overconfidence of the PF accompanied by the short experience of the PNF and the lack of an interactive CRM.- Possible blockage of the static pitot system, which would generate erroneous indications of speed, height and attitude. - Possible loss of situational awareness (perception of self and aircraft in relation to dynamic flight environment and threats, with ability to predict what will happen based on perception)- By not energizing the Flight System, the Artificial Horizon Instrument (ADI) model installed in the Aircraft gives a permanent ascent indication. This model of instrument does not have an indication flag when it is out of operation, the inoperability of the instrument is indicated at the bottom of the instrument where there is a bar that only changes color from red (out of operation) to black (operational). - Maintaining a flight with speeds above the VMO, a situation aggravated by a turn; being in weather conditions where speed must be reduced to maintain control of the aircraft.- Location of a GPS not enabled in a position that could confuse the crew for its luminosity.06-06-2012",Cargo,CIAIA Uruguay ,2012

Five skydivers were killed, two  crew members and 13 skydivers were seriously injured, two skydivers received minor injuries.It was returning to the airfield because of an approaching rainstorm.According to the findings of the commission of inquiry, the most likely cause of the crash was the impact of the aircraft in a low-altitude wind due to strong downward air flow (micro-burst) during the landing of the aircraft in thunderstorms due to coincidence of the following negative factors. - failure of the crew to perform a go around or divert to the alternate aerodrome; - a rapid increase in the speed of movement of the thunderstorm in the direction of the Borodyanka airfield area; - lack of training on the simulator in the conditions of wind shear, lack of experience in the crew on approach to landing in the conditions of wind shear, in particular micro-burst; - insufficient aeronautical equipment (lack of meteorological radar on the plane and airfield); - lack of information for the crew about the forecasted and actual meteorological conditions at the landing aerodrome, warnings about the forecasted / available wind shift at Borodyanka aerodrome; - the crew was not sufficiently informed about the flight conditions due to insufficient lighting of the cockpit and failure of the instrumentation of the aircraft due to a power filure during approach in thunderstorm conditions; - lack of sufficient experience of the crew to perform activities and landings in conditions when the landing weight exceeded the maximum allowable, due to the presence of skydivers on board the aircraft; - motivation of the crew to perform the landing approach on the first attempt, due to insufficient information about the storm at the aerodrome. The information on wind increase and its direction (provided to the pilot) was perceived by the crew as possible conditions for landing because their parameters did not exceed the limits allowed by the AOM of the aircraft; - overloading of the aircraft, motivation of the decision of the captain to perform landing at the aerodrome of departure (Borodyanka) due to the presence of unregistered passengers on board, due to improper organization of boarding of skydivers at the aerodrome Borodyanka; - insufficient organization of flights at Borodyanka airfield in terms of meteorological support; - insufficient (weak) regulatory, regulatory, legislative framework for parachuting.10-06-201210-06-201210-06-201210-06-2012",Parachuting,,2012

He was conducting line training of the co-pilot, a first officer who had recently joined the company.The short flight to Jersey was without incident and the weather for landing was reported as good, with the wind from 210° at 16 kt, few clouds at 2,000 ft and visibility in excess of 10 km. The commander elected to carry out a visual approach to runway 27 at Jersey, using a planned approach speed of 107 kt and flap 30 selected for landing.During the approach, the gear was selected down and the flight crew confirmed the three green 'gear safe' indication lights were illuminated, indicating that the gear was locked in the down position. The commander reported that both the approach and touchdown seemed normal, with the crosswind from the left resulting in the left main gear touching first.Just after touchdown both pilots heard a noise and the aircraft appeared to settle slightly differently from usual. The captain considered that a tyre had burst. The cabin crewmember also heard a noise after touchdown which she too thought was from a tyre bursting. The commander selected ground idle and partial reverse pitch and, as the aircraft decelerated through 70 kt, the co-pilot took over control of the ailerons, as per standard procedures, to allow the commander to take control of the steering tiller. Despite applying corrective inputs the aircraft continued rolling to the left. The aircraft continued to quickly roll to the left until the left wingtip and propeller contacted the runway. The aircraft remained on the runway, rapidly coming to a halt to the left of the centreline, approximately abeam Holding Point D. Both propellers continued to rotate and the commander selected the condition levers to the fuel shutoff position and pulled the fire handles to shut both engines down. It was determined that the left side brace upper arm had suffered a fatigue failure. The failure rendered the side brace ineffective and the unrestrained main trunnion continued to translate outboard, leading to the collapse of the gear. The aluminium brace was found to contain a small metallurgical feature at the crack origin which was consistent with titanium rich particles (TiB2) particles which are introduced as a grain refiner during casting of the billet prior to forging. The size of the feature was within the defined specifications for AL7010-T74. Analysis of the area surrounding the crack origin revealed an area of static loading before propagating a crack in fatigue, indicating that there may have been a single overload event at some point in the history of the side brace upper arm.PROBABLE CAUSE The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.16-06-201216-06-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2012

There were no injuries to the 31 passengers and 4 crewmembers onboard and the airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from Little Rock Airport (LIT), Arkansas.The first officer was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring for the flight. During climb out after departure from LIT the first officer and the captain noticed a different airflow noise than normal when the landing gear was selected up. They observed an amber nose gear door open advisory light, a master caution, and a landing gear inoperative caution light. The three green gear indication lights and three red gear indication lights were extinguished indicating the landing gear was retracted. The captain performed the Nose Gear Door Malfunctions check list contained in the Quick Reference Handbook and the crew maintained airspeed of at or below 185 knots for the remainder of the flight as stated in the checklist.During the flight to IAH, the crew heard a ""thump"" and observed the nose gear door amber status light and the LDG GEAR INOP caution light had extinguished.In accordance with the Nose Gear Door Malfunctions check list, and guidance received from company maintenance and system operations control via ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System), the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist for landing at IAH.The crew exchanged roles as the captain became the pilot flying and the first officer assumed the role of pilot monitoring for the remainder of the flight.Approximately over the ROKIT intersection, about 50 miles from IAH, the first officer began to perform the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist.At 103334 the first officer pulled the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle and observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated. The alternate gear indication lights in the floor near the nose gear release handle agreed with the primary gear indication lights on the flight deck panel.After the Alternate Gear Extension Procedure was completed, the crew could hear the nose gear door was ""flapping loosely"". The flight crew conducted a low approach and air traffic control tower personnel advised them that the nose gear doors appeared to be open but the nose gear did not appear to be down.At 105652 the captain briefed the cabin crew members and advised them that an evacuation, if necessary, would be conducted using the forward doors. The flight crew configured the airplane for landing at flaps 35 on runway 9 with the main landing gear down, and the nose landing gear retracted.At 110746, after passing through about 1,000 feet on approach, the first officer made a ""brace"" call over the passenger address system. The main gear touched down at 110850 and the captain held the nose off the runway until the airplane slowed to about 80 knots. Once the nose touched down, there were sparks and smoke resulting from the fuselage scraping the runway and the airplane came to a stop at about 1109. The captain ordered an evacuation and the pilots performed the On Ground Emergencies checklist. The passengers and crew evacuated through the forward cabin doors and were bussed to the terminal.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The nose landing gear alternate release handle was not pulled with sufficient enough force or distance to release the uplocks and allow extension of the nose landing gear.Contributing to the accident was the dissimilar pull force and pull length set on the flight simulator that was used for flight crew training of alternate landing gear extension procedures and the lack of information available to crew members advising of the dissimilar pull force.""04-07-201204-07-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2012

The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the 3 crew and 14 passengers escaped uninjured.During the 35-minute flight from Male to the Conrad Maldivian Resort, the weather was deteriorating with strong winds (approx 40-45 knots) from a westerly direction. The copilot, being pilot flying, landed the aircraft landed safely and the captain took over controls as a normal procedure and taxied through the channel for docking at the fixed platform attached to the main jetty.Since it was a fixed platform the crew had difficulty docking the aircraft in strong tailwind and swells. At the first attempt to dock the aircraft ended up forward of the platform which made the crew to abort docking. On the second attempt to dock, the captain applied full reverse and right rudder while the co-pilot applied opposite aileron to overcome the strong winds as the aircraft approached the fixed platform.However, the aircraft moved forward and hit the platform hard and the cabin crew, who was at his station on the left hand float, was flung into the water. On impact with the platform the left hand float attachments were sheared and the left hand propeller blades struck the platform surface while the right hand float lifted up and struck the right hand propeller. The captain reported cutting off the fuel at the first impact. The aircraft started turning, pivoting at its nose near the platform then started drifting away due to the strong winds and swells. Immediately after the impact water started seeping inside the aircraft. The captain attempted to secure the aircraft and the copilot was attempting to facilitate evacuation of the passengers. The cabin crew member swam to the aircraft and joined the crew in the evacuation process. All the passengers and crew were able to evacuate the aircraft before the fuselage was fully submerged.AICC determines that the probable cause(s) of the accident as followsPilot in Command's miss judgement of wind condition and its effect during docking procedure resulting in the aircraft colliding with the docking platform at a very high speed. Major contributing factor was high tail winds and adverse weather condition prevailing at the time of accident.09-07-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AICC Maldives ,2012

All three occupants were killed.The aircraft initially arrived at Nice-Côte d'Azur Airport (NCE) following a flight from Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Turkey. Three passengers deplaned at Nice. Since the parking area at Nice was full, the airplane was to be ferried to Le Castellet. Takeoff was accomplished at 1456 hours local time and the aircraft climbed to FL160 for a short flight to Le Castellet.At the destination, the crew was cleared to perform a visual approach to runway 13. The autopilot and the auto-throttle were disengaged, the gear was down and the flaps in the landing position. The GND SPOILER UNARM message, indicating nonarming of the ground spoilers, was displayed on the EICAS and the associated single chime aural warning was triggered. This message remained displayed on the EICAS until the end of the flight since the crew forgot to arm the ground spoilers during the approach. At a height of 25 ft, while the aircraft was flying over the runway threshold slightly below the theoretical descent path, a SINK RATE warning was triggered. The pilot flying corrected the flight path and the touchdown of the main landing gear took place 15 metres after the touchdown zone, which is 365 metres from the threshold, and slightly left of the centre line of runway 13. The ground spoilers, not armed, did not automatically deploy. The crew braked and actuated the deployment of the thrust reversers, which did not deploy completely. The hydraulic pressure available at brake level slightly increased. The deceleration of the airplane was slow. Four seconds after touchdown, a MASTER WARNING was triggered. A second MASTER WARNING was generated five seconds later.The nose landing gear touched down for the first time 785 metres beyond the threshold before the aeroplane's pitch attitude increased again, causing a loss of contact of the nose gear with the ground. The aircraft crossed the runway centre line to the right, the crew correcting this by a slight input on the rudder pedals to the left. They applied a strong nose-down input and the nose gear touched down on the runway a second time, 1050 metres beyond the threshold.The speedbrakes were then manually actuated by the crew with an input on the speed brake control, which then deployed the panels. Maximum thrust from the thrust reversers was reached one second later. The aircraft at this time was 655 metres from the runway end and its path began to curve to the left. In response to this deviation, the crew made a sharp input on the right rudder pedal, to the stop, and an input on the right brake, but failed to correct the trajectory. The aeroplane, skidding to the right, ran off the runway to the left 385 metres from the runway end at a ground speed of approximately 95 knots.It struck a runway edge light, the PAPI of runway 31, a metal fence then trees and caught fire instantly.An aerodrome firefighter responded quickly onsite but did not succeed in bringing the fire under control.Causes of the accidentForgetting to arm the ground spoilers delayed the deployment of the thrust reversers despite their selection. Several MASTER WARNING alarms were triggered and the deceleration was low. The crew then responded by applying a strong nose-down input in order to make sure that the aeroplane stayed in contact with the ground, resulting in unusually high load for a brief moment on the nose gear. After that, the nose gear wheels deviated to the left as a result of a left input on the tiller or a failure in the steering system. It was not possible to establish a formal link between the high load on the nose gear and this possible failure. The crew was then unable to avoid the runway excursion at high speed and the collision with trees.The aerodrome fire-fighter, alone at the time of the intervention, was unable to bring the fire under control after the impact. Although located outside of the runway safety area on either side of the runway centre line, as provided for by the regulations, the presence of rocks and trees near the runway contributed to the consequences of the accident.The accident was caused by the combination of the following factors- the ground spoilers were not armed during the approach;- a lack of a complete check of the items with the ""before landing"" checklist, and more generally the UJT crews' failure to systematically perform the checklists as a challenge and response to ensure the safety of the flight;- procedures and ergonomics of the aeroplane that were not conducive to monitoring the extension of the ground spoilers during the landing;- a possible left input on the tiller or a failure of the nose gear steering system having caused its orientation to the left to values greater than those that can be commanded using the rudder pedals, without generating any warning;- a lack of crew training in the ""Uncommanded Nose Wheel Steering"" procedure, provided to face uncommanded orientations of the nose gear;- an introduction of this new procedure that was not subject to a clear assessment by Gulfstream or the FAA;- failures in updating the documentation of the manufacturer and the operator;- monitoring by the FAA that failed to detect both the absence of any updates of this documentation and the operating procedure for carrying out checklists by the operator.13-07-2012",Ferry/positioning,BEA ,2012

There were no injuries.Sky Airline flight SKU-101 departed Antofagasta (ANF) at 1535 on a domestic flight to La Serena (LSC). The visibility at La Serena was deteriorating but was still reported to be about 6000 m at the time of the approach.At 1657 the flight crew contacted the controller at La Serena, reporting 31 nautical miles North of the Serena VOR. They were cleared to carry out a visual approach with a right hand base leg to runway 30. At 1705 Flight 101 reported to be at 5.4 nautical miles from the Serena VOR. The controller cleared the flight to land on runway 30.Instead of flying a base leg, the pilot flying made a diagonal approach to runway 30. During final approach, the aircraft was never aligned with the (extended) centreline of the runway.Over the runway the airplane banked right. The right hand wing tip contacted the runway. The pilot aborted the landing and executed a go around. It appeared that the right hand wing tip was deflected upwards and had sustained substantial damage. There was also some damage to a flap fairing. The crew decided to diverted to Copiapó-Chamonate Airport (CPO) where a safe landing was made at 1747.Cause (translated from Spanish)The cause of the accident was an unstabilized approach to runway 30 at the aerodrome of Florida, in the city of La Serena, which meant that the aircraft impacted the runway with the right wing.Contributing factors1. Performing an approach without complying with the procedures for a visual approach indicated in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) and Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM).2.

All four other crew members on board were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight which departed Cambridge Airfield.The airplane had been operating as a communications relay for the London Olympics and was returning to Cambridge. While descending to FL180 the pilots experienced a progressive failure of all of the electrical equipment, with the exception of the left instrument panel Electronic Flight Information System display. This remained powered by a backup power supply. However, as the display was giving erroneous information, the pilots decided to turn it off. The abnormal checklist did not contain a procedure for a total electrical failure, so the Pilot Flying turned off both generators and the battery switch before selecting them on again in an attempt to restore the electrical supply. He also selected the alternate inverter and the PNF recycled the cabin power supply switches. The PF stated that he did not attempt to select the generators to RESET. The left instrument panel had functioning ASI and vertical speed indicator (VSI) instruments; the right panel had a working attitude indicator (which was vacuum-driven), ASI and altimeter indications. The engine rpm gauges and standby compass remained operational. Mindful of avoiding a security alert during the Olympic Games, the crew carried out the pre-briefed communications failure procedure and turned the aircraft onto a northerly heading to clear the London TMA, before proceeding towards a designated holding area. As the aircraft approached the Wisbech area, the commander recognised some land features. The aircraft descended to 5,000 ft from where the crew were able to identify additional landmarks and navigate visually towards Cambridge Airport. By this time the aircraft had been flying for some time without electrical power and therefore without operating fuel gauges, and the crew were concerned about the aircraft's remaining endurance.When they arrived near the airport, they circled it to alert ATC to their presence and then carried out the Landing Gear Manual Extension procedure. When carrying out the procedure the pilots operated the landing gear control handle, but omitted to pull the landing gear relay circuit breaker. The PF operated the alternate extension handle to extend the landing gear. Initially, the handle was easy to operate and the pilots could see the main landing gear as it started to extend. The PF stated that he stopped operating the handle when heavy resistance was felt, in order not to damage the system. The PF also stated that the PNF had mentioned to him not to force the handle. The PF asked the PNF to check the resistance of the handle, which he did. The PF continued to operate the handle whilst they positioned the aircraft downwind and onto base leg, but stopped pumping each time he felt heavy resistance.The PF carried out a flapless approach and the aircraft touched down gently at approximately 100 kt. Almost immediately after touchdown, the landing gear started to collapse. The PNF immediately operated the fuel condition levers which shut down the engines and feathered the propellers. The aircraft settled onto the centreline luggage pod and the main undercarriage doors. It came to rest after a total ground run of approximately 400 m, during which it yawed slightly to the right. The PF was able to counteract the yaw with rudder sufficiently to prevent the aircraft from leaving the paved surface.After it had come to a halt, the commander ordered the technicians to evacuate. The pilots then completed the shutdown checklist before also vacating the aircraft. The flight time from the electrical failure until the landing was approximately 37 minutes.CONCLUSIONS ""No cause for the electrical failure could be determined and no fault was found with the landing gear system. It is possible that the gear collapsed on landing because the crew ceased operating the alternate extension handle before the landing gear was fully extended. The electrical failure meant that the crew had no indication of the landing gear position and therefore could not confirm that the gear was down and locked prior to landing.""",Survey/research,AAIB ,2012

Both pilots were killed in the accident.They had flown a transplant organ to Porto that night and were returning to Santiago de Compostela, leaving Oviedo Airport at 0545.Ten minutes later, the crew contacted approach control and was then authorized to make the ILS approach to runway 17 at Santiago de Compostela. The visibility at the airport was suitable for landing. At 0615 hours the crew contacted Tower Control and was cleared to land. Two minutes later the aircraft impacted wooded terrain, 200 meters before the VOR of Santiago, about 1 mile before the threshold of runway 17.CausesThe ultimate cause of the accident could not be determined. In light of the hypothesis considered in the analysis, the most likely scenario is that the crew made a non-standard precision approach in manual based primarily on distances. The ILS frequency set incorrectly in the first officer's equipment and the faulty position indicated on the DME switch would have resulted in the distance being shown on the captain's HSI as corresponding to the VOR and not to the runway threshold. The crew shortened the approach maneuver and proceeded to a point by which the aircraft should already have been established on the localizer, thus increasing the crew's workload. The crew then probably lost visual contact with the ground when the aircraft entered a fog bank in the valleys near the airport and did not realize they were making an approach to the VOR and not to the runway.The contributing factors were- The lack of operational procedures of an aircraft authorized to be operated by a single pilot operated by a crew with two members.- The overall condition of the aircraft and the instruments and the crew's mistrust of the onboard instruments.- The fatigue built up over the course of working at a time when they should have been sleeping after an unplanned duty period.- The concern with having to divert to the alternate without sufficient fuel combined with the complacency arising from finally reaching their destination.02-08-201202-08-201202-08-201202-08-201202-08-2012",Ferry/positioning,CIAIAC ,2012

The nose landing gear was ruptured and fuselage skin was damaged due to colliding with the concrete base of four taxiway lights.Findings related to probable causes During landing phase, the flight crew early flare the aircraft, did not timely retract the thrust lever to idle position. The flight crew continued holding to the control column and did not initiate a go around or reject landing after the aircraft landed beyond the touchdown zone. After landing, the flight crew did not apply the best deceleration procedures, incorrectly considered the aircraft encountered hydroplaning and intentionally controlled the aircraft out of the runway to the grass field when approaching the end of runway.

It was the first of 4 flights planned on that day for the crew. At 1427 local time the aircraft left took off with 32 passengers and 3 crew members. The co-pilot was the pilot flying (PF), and the pilot-in-command was the pilot monitoring (PM).Cruising at 14 000 feet above sea level (asl), the crew received clearance from air traffic control to perform a contact approach on runway 29 at Gaspé. At 1403 local time the PF began the descent and headed directly toward the OVUBI final approach fix, located 5.5 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold of runway 29.At 1410, the aircraft intercepted the final approach 5 nm from the runway, at a height above touchdown zone elevation of about 2400 feet and a speed of 138 knots. The aircraft reached the optimum descent angle of 3° from above and continued its approach, descending gradually below the slope indicated by the precision approach path indicator (PAPI). At approximately 170 feet, when the aircraft descended below the lower limit of the PAPI range (with 4 red lights visible), the pilot flying reduced power; the rate of descent increased, and the aircraft was aiming for the runway threshold. At about 45 feet, when the aircraft was 700 feet from the runway threshold, power was reduced to idle, and speed dropped to VREF +3 in deceleration.At 1412, the aircraft made a hard landing, during which the lower part of the aft fuselage came into contact with the runway and the ""Touched Runway"" indicator came on. The first wheel marks of the right main gear appeared at 109 feet from the threshold of runway 29.After landing, the aircraft backtracked normally on the runway, taxied, and parked in front of the air terminal.An examination of the aircraft revealed traces of the impact and scuff marks on the skin, structural stiffeners and longerons of the lower portion of the fuselage. Depressions and deformations of the skin were observed on the lateral surfaces of the fuselage under the wings and under the tail unit.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The application of a pronounced nose-up control to reduce the rate of descent resulted in a nose-high attitude. This attitude, combined with a hard landing that compressed the oleos, resulted in the aft part of the fuselage striking the runway, causing significant damage to the aircraft structure.2. The pilot monitoring was focusing attention outside and did not identify the loss of energy in time to notify the pilot flying or to intervene and thereby prevent the hard landing.3. The aircraft crossed the runway threshold with insufficient energy to stop the rate of descent with only an increase in the nose-up attitude at the time of the flare.4. The crew had not received training on the technique recommended by the manufacturer in the event of a higher than normal rate of descent near the ground. As a result, the pilot flying did not limit the nose-up attitude or increase power to reduce the rate of descent, and the aircraft fuselage struck the runway.10-09-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2012

Weather at the destination airport Palana included a visibility of 6000 m and a cloud base at 470 m. This was within limits for an approach and landing at Palana. The crew were cleared for an approach to runway 11. The approach to Palana consists of a flight to the NDB beacon above the minimum safe altitude of 2150 m, followed by entering a holding pattern, and a descent for the approach. The crew did not fly to the NDB. The flight was 22 km from the NDB when the crew reported being overhead.Descent was initiated until the airplane struck trees at 320 m above sea level on the wooded slope of Mount Pyatibratka.Cause of the accident aircraft involving An-28 RA-28715 was a violation by the crew of the established approach procedures at the airport Palana, by carrying out a premature descent to below the minimum safe altitude when flying in mountainous terrain, weather conditions, precluding sustained visual contact with ground reference points, which led to a crash of the aircraft with the mountainside, its destruction and the death of the crew and passengers. Alcohol was discovered in the blood of both crew members.Contributing factors were- a low level of discipline of personnel and unsatisfactory flight methodical work in the aviation enterprise in terms of the lack of control over pre-flight preparation by the crew and execution of the approach procedures; - inaction by the crew after the altimeter alarm when reaching a dangerous altitude;Availability on the An-28 aircraft of a ground proximity warning system (GPWS), could possibly have prevent the accident.12-09-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2012

At 133918 hrs, the pilot three times declared an emergency. The aircraft stalled and impacted terrain in a field of sweet corn with a low forward airspeed and a steep descent.A preliminary technical investigation revealed that both engines suffered from fuel starvation. Both wing fuel tanks and wingtip tanks were empty. The fuselage tank was drained and contained 160 liters of fuel. The engines were supplied with fuel from the wing tanks only. In order to use the fuel from the fuselage tank, the fuel had to be transferred into the wing tanks. Two valves, a fuel transfer valve and a fuel cross flow valve were found in closed position which was consistent with the position of the fuselage tank switch.Investigators reported on Danish tv that the person in the right hand seat in the cockpit did have a license needed to be a co-pilot on the jet. The Mexican captain of the jet was charged with fraud and endangerment by Danish police on September 20. He was not in possession of a valid German pilot license.Also, the German Aviation Authorities informed the AIB DK that the certificate of aircraft registration was cancelled in 2009.

During the takeoff run, while approaching 70 kt, approximately 13 kt below V1 and VR, the first officer called ""Vee one rotate"". The aircraft began to rotate but did not lift off the ground and the nosewas briefly lowered again. As the aircraft reached 86 kt, it lifted off the ground and the landing gear was raised immediately.As the aircraft began to climb, it accelerated to 89 kt over approximately two seconds. It continued to climb to 100 ft above the runway over the next 11 seconds but, during this time, the speed decreased to 77 kt. The aircraft then flew level for 14 seconds during which time the following occurred the speed decreased to 69 kt; the air traffic controller asked ""Any technical?"" to whichthe pilot replied ""[uncertain] due bird hit""; it's heading changed slowly from 200 °M to approximately 173 °M; and the stall warning was triggered for three seconds as the aircraft decelerated through 71 kt.Two seconds after the stall warning ended, it was triggered again for approximately six seconds with the airspeed at 69 kt.

No evidence of bird remains was found in the engines.Causal FactorsThe investigation identified the following causal factors1. During level flight phase of the aircraft, the drag on the aircraft was greater than the power available and the aircraft decelerated. That resulted in excessive drag in such critical phase of ascent lowering the required thrust. The investigation was unable to determine the reason for the reduced thrust.2. The flight crew did not maintain the airspeed above the stall speed and there was insufficient height available to recover when the aircraft departed controlled flight.(c) Contributory FactorsThe investigation identified the following contributory factors1. The flight crew did not maintain V2 during the climb and so the power required to maintain the level flight was greater than it would otherwise have been.2.

Weather conditions at the time of departure were good, although convective clouds and heavy rain showers had passed over the airport while the aircraft was parked before flight. Approximately 40 mm of rain fell at the airport during this period. There was no evidence that a water drain check was carried out on the aircraft following the rainfall.Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft yawed and rolled to the right, descending rapidly and apparently out of control. It impacted the ground within the airport perimeter, right wingtip first and steeply banked to the right at low forward speed.Examination of the wreckage showed the right hand engine was not producing power at the time of impact. Investigation of the fuel system showed contamination with significant quantities of water.The right-hand fuel filler cap was of a design that was incompatible with the filler neck. Tests showed that the cap, installed in the neck, could allow water to pass into the fuel tank, for example if the aircraft were parked during periods of rain.Causal factors1. Significant rainfall, and anomalies in the aircrafts fuel filler neck and cap, led to the presence of water in the right-hand fuel tank 2. Shortly after takeoff, the water in the right-hand fuel tank entered the engine fuel system causing the engine to stop running 3. Control of the aircraft was not retained after the right-hand engine stopped The investigation identified the following contributory factors1. No pre-flight water drain check was carried out; such a check would have allowed the presence of water in the right-hand fuel tank to be detected and corrective action taken2.

The study of wind components shows that the aircraft was influenced by cross-wind gusts.During the landing, the aircraft received a gust of wind from the right. In this situation, the aircraft would have swerved to the right. Thus, the nose of the aircraft deviated 20° to the right in relation to the axis of the runway, which allowed a trajectory of exit of the runway, which was not sufficiently corrected.",Private,CENIPA ,2012

The captain was pilot flying. This was the fifth and last flight of the day for the crew.At 2100, just prior to descent, the crew listened to ATIS information Whisky, which indicated that runway 07 was in use with a PAR procedure. Four minutes later the controller at Lorient reported that winds were from 160° at 17 kt with gusts to 26 kt. The flight then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 (CAT I), which was approved.At 2110, the controller repeated the wind conditions and reported that ""the runway is wet with puddles (mouillée avec flaques deau)"" and that the preceding aircraft had difficulties during landing due to aquaplaning. Shortly thereafter, the controller reported showers at the airfield and the visibility had decreased to 2000 m.At 2112, the crew was cleared to descend to 3000 ft. The controller stated that a runway inspection found that the runway was ""wet with puddles"", repeating the information about the previous landing.At 2120, the aircraft was established on the ILS at an altitude of about 1900 ft and a speed of 180 kt. Planned approach speed Vapp was 140 kts. The autopilot was engaged. The flight was cleared to land and at 1000 ft, with a 4 knot tail wind, the aircraft was established on the ILS with a speed of 144 kt. The crew concluded that the approach was stable and continued their descent through the rain. Wind screen wipers were set at maximum. Meanwhile the speed increased to 154 knots at the time the airplane passed 500 feet.The autopilot was then disconnected. The airplane crossed the threshold of runway 25 at a height of 56 feet and at a speed of 153 knots. The copilot reported to the captain that visibility was poor and that they were slightly left of the runway centreline. Nine seconds later, the main gear touched down about 1130 m from the threshold of runway 25, which is 2230 m long. The ground speed was 140 kts. The spoilers were then deployed and the crew deployed the thrust reversers, applying maximum reverse thrust. The airplane did not decelerate as expected and left the runway at a ground speed of 66 kts. It struck localizer antennas before coming to rest about 200 m from the threshold of runway 07.The crew issued a distress call and ordered the evacuation of the aircraft.The accident was caused by the crew deciding not to abort the landing although they were not aware either of the degree to which runway conditions were contaminated or of the remaining length of runway available.Continuing the landing can be explained by- Insufficient situational awareness linked to* Crew performance degraded by fatigue and routine,* Unfamiliarity with safety margins and inadequate TEM training;- An approach to safety by the operator that did not encourage crews to question their plan of action.The following factors contributed to the incident- The crews under-estimation of the meteorological conditions;- Operational instructions that were sometimes unclear or contradictory, thereby undermining teamwork;- The characteristics of runway 25, which were also not documented in the Brit Air Operations Manual;- The organisation of aerodrome operations that contributed to the deviations identified concerning runway 25 not being corrected in a timely manner;- A lack of common phraseology that would guarantee crews and controllers to \have a shared comprehension of the true condition of the runway;- The organisation of training and checks that prevented the operator from recognising and improving its safety performance;- Incomplete integration of the risks of fatigue by the airline.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2012

There were no injuries to the three passengers or three crewmembers onboard and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The flight had originated from Tarin Kowt Airport (TII), AfghanistanAccording to the flight crew, the takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. The captain was the flying pilot. At 1112 the flight was cleared for the approach and at 1116 the flight crew selected flaps 35 and initiated a random steep approach in accordance with company task procedures as a result of the airport threat level. According to the flight crew statements, the airplane engine power was reduced to idle for the approach and was not increased prior to landing. Information obtained from Flight Data Recorder (FDR) indicated engine torque was at or near zero for the last 5 minutes of approach and landing.The aviation routine weather report at 0550 local time indicated wind from 120 degrees at 5 knots, 8000 meters visibility and temperature 17 degrees C. For the two minutes prior to landing, the wind was light and variable. A tactical meteorological observation system on the field reported the wind direction during the two minutes prior to landing as variable from 004 degrees to 137 degrees and the wind speed variable from 1 knot to 7.2 knots. Wind gust recorded during the time period varied from 050 degrees to 079 degrees at 7.0 to 7.2 knots.Based on FDR data the calculated rate of descent was about 2,000 feet per minute during approach, reducing to about 1,500 feet per minute just prior to landing. The airplane touched down with a nose up pitch attitude of approximately 8 degrees and a peak vertical acceleration of 2.7g. The airplane geometry information provided by the manufacturer indicated that aft fuselage contact will result from a pitch attitude over 11.9 degrees with an extended landing gear oleo strut, and a pitch attitude over 6.8 degrees with a compressed landing gear oleo strut.In order to avoid nuisance warnings resulting from the random steep approach (i.e. steep angle descent), the flight crew deactivated the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) for approach. As these alerts would be expected by the crew during this type of approach, it is unlikely the alerts would have prompted the crew to take corrective action.The airplane touched down and contacted the aft fuselage on the runway resulting in substantial damage (including buckled, cracked, and bent frames and stringers).PROBABLE CAUSE ""The captains ineffective management of the airplanes energy state during final approach and flare that resulted in a hard landing and tail strike at touchdown.""17-10-2012",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,,2012

The Captain immediately aborted the take-off when the left wing of the aircraft suddenly started to droop downwards. The Fire and Rescue Services immediately extinguished a fire that had started at the left-hand main landing gear wheels and brake assemblies. During an onsite inspection, it was discovered that the inboard and outboard main wheel tires were destroyed by scraping onto the runway surface and by the fire that started at the left-hand main wheel brakes and tires.The CAA investigation team is of the opinion that during the fitment of No.1 wheel assembly, low torque or an improperly seated bearing most probably caused the bearing not to track properly in the bearing race. The uncommon vibration that was felt over the wing area during taxi indicates that No.1 Outboard (smaller) Bearing migrated outboard and dislodged itself. It was then captured by the wheel cap that prevented it from departing completely from the wheel assembly. The No.1Outboard Bearing also showed very little evidence of deterioration. The No.1 Wheel and Brake Assembly subsequently migrated outboard, and consequently the brake assembly dislodged itself from its locating lug, tilted and jammed the inner bearing and brake rotors, causing a sudden and complete stoppage of the wheel assembly.As the aircraft was still taxiing, No.1 Tire then deflated due to being stationary and from dragging and friction with the asphalt. With No.1 Tire being flat and during the taxi and maneuvering onto Runway 03L, No.2 Tire took severe strain under the aircraft load. During the start of the takeoff run No.2 Tire most probably burst or deflated but continued rotating whilst No.1 Tire was dragging as indicated by the witness marks on Runway 03L. Both tires then disintegrated during the takeoff run.Probable CauseNo. 1 Main wheel bearings failed due to incorrect installation and torque procedures when No 1 main landing gear wheel assembly was replaced, the day before the incident occurred.Contributory FactorThe possibility exists that the wheel nut was not even torqued during the wheel replacement as vibration and a rattling noise was coming from the landing gear even during taxing.13-11-201213-11-2012",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,CAA SouthAfrica ,2012

After about 360 metres of the landing run, the crew felt some violent vibrations, which increased as the speed decreased. The airplane veered off to the left. The crew applied heavy braking and tried in vain to use the nosewheel steering.At less than 45 kt, the airplane exited the runway to the left about 800 metres after nosewheel touchdown. The nose gear struck a recessed concrete inspection pit and collapsed. The airplane slid for a few dozen metres before coming to a stop. The crew evacuated the aeroplane.ConclusionIncorrect installation of one or more washers on the nose gear torque link centre hinge made it impossible to lock the hinge shaft nut effectively. The unscrewing and the detachment of the latter in service caused the loss of nose gear steering. Free on its axle, the nose gear bogie began to shimmy, which made the aeroplane veer to the left. The aeroplane exited the runway and the nose gear collapsed during the collision with a concrete inspection pit for access to the runway lighting electric cables.The runway excursion was due to the incorrect and undetected re-assembly of the nose gear torque links.Despite the presence of a detailed diagram, the absence of clear and detailed instructions in the text of the manufacturers AMM, allowing the operator to ensure that the assembly was correct, contributed to the incorrect assembly.The failure of the nose gear was due to the collision with an obstacle in the runway strip.The absence of any regulation requiring that equipment in the immediate vicinity of a runway or of a runway overrun area be designed so as to limit as much as possible any damage to aeroplanes, in case of a runway excursion, contributed to the accident.16-11-201216-11-201216-11-2012",Cargo,BEA ,2012

The pilot died and the seven passengers were injured. Gogal Air Services was engaged by a local mining company to transport employees between Snow Lake and Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Caravan had accumulated some rime ice on the leading edges of the wings and the horizontal stabilizer from the flight into Snow Lake on the previous day. During the pre-flight inspection, the pilot tapped the leading edges of the wings with a broom handle in an attempt to remove the ice, but did not do this on the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft. Ice remained on the leading edges of the wings and tail before the flight. No de-icing or anti-icing fluids were applied to the wing or horizontal stabilizer, and no tactile inspection of the upper wing or tail surfaces was observed.The airplane departed at 0955 and climbed to about 225 feet above ground level. It then pitched down. The aircraft's tail began to shudder and oscillate, the wings rocked, and a more pronounced second downward pitch ensued before the aircraft contacted the trees and crashed. There was no fire.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The aircraft departed Snow Lake overweight and with an accumulation of ice on the leading edges of its wings and tail from the previous flight. As a result, the aircraft had reduced take-off and climb performance and increased stall speed, and the protection afforded by its stall warning system was impaired.2. A breakdown in the companys operational control resulted in the flight not operating in accordance with the Canadian Aviation Regulations and the company operations manual.3. As a result, shortly after departure, the aircraft stalled at an altitude from which recovery was not possible.18-11-201218-11-2012",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2012

The An-26 touched down slightly left of the runway centreline and drifted further to the left. The left hand main landing gear ran into a 20-50 cm high snow bank at the edge of the runway. The airplane ran off the runway and came to rest on snowy terrain. The nose undercarriage collapsed and the right hand wing twisted forward, causing the no. 2 engine to touch the ground.Conclusion (translated from Russian)The cause of the accident without casualties to the aircraft AN 26B RA-26061 was a runway excursion, resulting in damage to the entire structure. The accident was made possible due to a combination of the following factors - error in piloting technique, expressed in correcting the approach up to the moment of landing, which led to a landing at an angle to the runway centreline and significantly to the left of the centreline- a mismatch between the runway condition and the unpaved runway regulations REGA RF-94, in terms of distance between cleared and uncleared surface of unpaved runways with a slope less than 110; - the aircraft swung left when the left main landing gear entered fresh snow 30-50cm in height as a result of burying both left main landing gear wheels in the snow.21-11-201221-11-201221-11-201221-11-201221-11-201221-11-2012",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2012

The purpose of the flight was a local VFR training flight for a pilot under instruction to reset his currencies on the type. Following some air work the crew flew some traffic patterns and two touch-and-go landings. While on a right downwind leg, the crew advised the air traffic control (ATC) tower that they would make a full stop landing. ATC acknowledged, told them to extend their downwind leg, and stated that the controller would call their base turn. The controller then called out the landing traffic that was currently on final approach, which was an Airbus A300-600 heavy. The flight crew replied back that they had the traffic in sight, and the controller cleared the flight to land, number two behind the preceding Airbus, and advised to have caution for wake turbulence. The crew observed their position was abeam the Airbus and estimated that they made the base turn about three miles from the runway. While making the turn, the flight crew discussed wake turbulence avoidance procedures and planned to make a steeper approach and land beyond the Airbus's touchdown point. The pilot flying added 10 to 15 knots to the Vref speed as a precaution. The reported winds provided by the tower controller were 180 degrees at 4 knots. The crew observed tire smoke from the Airbus as it touched down near the 1,500-foot runway markings. The flight crew discussed touching down at the 2,000-foot markings and continued. The Airbus continued on the runway, and the tower advised the Citation flight crew to be prepared for a go-around, should the Airbus not clear the runway in time, which the flight crew acknowledged. The flight crew estimated that the Airbus turned off the runway on taxiway F when they were about 1,000 feet from the threshold and about 200 feet above ground level (agl). The flight crew reported having a stabilized approach, and elected to continue while maintaining their planned landing point. When landing was assured, the pilot flying reduced the power levers.When the airplane was approximately 150 feet agl, established on runway centerline, it had an uncommanded left roll to 60 degrees of bank or beyond. The heading swung to the left to about 130 degrees and the nose dropped. The flight crew reported that the airplane was buffeting heavily and that they momentarily lost sight of the horizon. Immediately, the pilot not flying set full power and the pilot flying used both hands on the control wheel in an attempt to roll the airplane level and recover the pitch. The pilot flying managed to get the airplane nearly back to level when the right main landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold and left of the runway. Less than 50 feet after the right main landing gear had touched down, the airplane collided with a small drainage ditch and a dirt service road, causing the right main and the nose gear to collapse.

Weather conditions below published landing minima for the approach at the alternate airport CYGW (Kuujjuarapik) and insufficient fuel to make CYGL (La Grande Rivière) eliminated any favourable diversion options. The possibility of a successful landing at CYGW was considered unlikely and put pressure on the crew to land at CYSK (Sanikiluaq).3. Frustration, fatigue, and an increase in workload and stress during the instrument approaches resulted in crew attentional narrowing and a shift away from well-learned, highly practised procedures.4. Due to the lack of an instrument approach for the into-wind runway and the unsuccessful attempts at circling, the crew chose the option of landing with a tailwind, resulting in a steep, unstable approach.5. The final descent was initiated beyond the missed approach point and, combined with the 14-knot tailwind, resulted in the aircraft remaining above the desired 3-degree descent path.6. Neither pilot heard the ground proximity warning system warnings; both were focused on landing the aircraft to the exclusion of other indicators that warranted alternative action.  7. During the final approach, the aircraft was unstable in several parameters. This instability contributed to the aircraft being half-way down the runway with excessive speed and altitude.8. The aircraft was not in a position to land and stop within the confines of the runway, and a go-around was initiated from a low-energy landing regime.9. The captain possibly eased off on the control column in the climb due to the low airspeed. This, in combination with the configuration change at a critical phase of flight, as called for in the company procedures, may have contributed to the aircraft's poor climb performance.10. A rate of climb sufficient to ensure clearance from obstacles was not established, and the aircraft collided with terrain.11. The infant passenger was not restrained in a child restraint system, nor was one required by regulations. The infant was ejected from the mother's arms during the impact sequence, and contact with the interior surfaces of the aircraft contributed to the fatal injuries.22-12-201222-12-201222-12-2012OCT 1986N26863Resort Air06 APR 1987N26863Resort Air01 OCT 1989N26863Trans States Airlines05 MAY 1991N26863Mesaba AirlinesDEC 1994N26863Trans States Airlines10 DEC 1996N26863Merlin Express18 AUG 2003C-GFWXWestern Express Air LinesOCT 2004C-GFWX06 APR 2005C-GFWXPerimeter Aviation25 AUG 2010C-GFWXPerimeter Aviation",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2012

The aircraft was refueled at Mandalay after 60 passengers disembarked and 46 passengers boarded. The captain made the briefing and completed the aircraft checks. At 0826 local time, the flight departed Mandalay to Heho Airport. The first officer was designated as the Pilot Flying for the flight. The aircraft climbed to FL130 and the captain contacted Heho ATC at 50 NM from Heho. Heho ATC provided the present weather condition (wind calm, visibility 3000 m, distinct fog, temperature 17°C, QNH 1018 mb, runway 36 in use). At about 0836 local time, the first officer started the crew briefing. The aircraft started descend to 9000 ft and continued to overhead the Heho NDB. At about 0847 local time, while heading 220 degrees and descending to 6000 ft the flight commenced a non-precision Non Directional Beacon (NDB) approach to runway 36.During the final inbound track at about 2.5 NM to the runway at 0852, the EGPWS aural warning called out ""500"". The captain initiated ""Alt hold"" at about 0853, just before the EGPWS alert ""100"" ""50"" 40"" ""30"" and the aircraft struck 66 KV power lines, trees, telephone cables, a fence and collided with terrain short of the runway, coming to rest approximately 0.7 NM from the threshold. During the ground collision, both wings separated and a fire commenced almost immediately. An emergency evacuation was initiated by the cabin crews. One aircraft occupant and one motorcyclist on the ground were fatally injured, 70 of the occupants and one motorcyclist survived and the aircraft was destroyed by fire.Primary Cause- During the final approach, the aircraft descended below the MDA and the crew did not follow the operator SOP's.- The pilots had no corrective action against to change VMC to IMC during bad weather condition and insufficient time for effective respond to last moment.Secondary Cause- Captain of the aircraft had insufficient assessment on the risk that assigned the FO as PF.- There may be under pressure by the following aircrafts as the first plane on that day to Heho.25-12-201225-12-201222 FEB 1991PH-EZLFokker Aircraft BV25 JUN 1991PH-CFEFokker Aircraft BV1991(G-FIOX)(Air Europe)29 OCT 1993F-GJAOAir Littoral30 NOV 1995PH-CFEFokker Aircraft BV13 MAY 1996PH-CFEBritish Midland Airways06 JUL 1998G-BXWEBritish Midland Airways29 OCT 2003G-BXWEBritish Midland Airways14 AUG 2004G-BXWEBritish Midland Airways01 JUL 2005XY-AGCAir Bagan",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAIB ,2012

All 20 passengers and seven crew members were killed.The airplane was operated by the Kazakhstan Border Guards. Among those killed was acting director of National Security Committee's Border Guard Service, Colonel Turganbek Stambekov. The airplane took off from Astana Airport (TSE) at 1652 with destination Shymkent Airport (CIT). Shortly after takeoff the autopilot failed. The captain then decided to fly the plane manually. Two minutes and 40 seconds after takeoff the radio altimeter also failed. The flight was continued using barometric altimeters. Nineteen minutes into the flight there was a momentary failure of these altimeters as well, with the altitude dropping from 696 to -1375 metres. Three minutes later the altimeter again suffered a momentary spike, this time from 749 m to 2672 m.En route and during the descent towards Shymkent the flight encountered poor weather with heavy snowfall and limited visibility. During the approach to Shymkent, the captain failed to set the correct pressure for the barometric altimeters. The altitude indicated was therefore off by about 385 metres. The airplane struck the slope of a ravine 21 km short of the runway and broke up.25-12-2012",Military,,2012

The captain, copilot, flight engineer and two flight attendants were killed. The remaining three crew members sustained serious injuries.The airplane departed Pardubice Airport (PED), Czech Republic about 1110 local time as Red Wings Airlines flight RWZ9268 to Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO). Flight 9268 approached from the north and was cleared for landing on runway 19. The airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps at -37°, slats at -23°, and landing gear down. Decision height was 60 metres and the planned final approach speed was 210 km/h (113 kts).The final approach was flown in director mode with disabled automatic throttle. The approach was flown unstabilized at a speed of 255 km/h (138 kts) without significant deviations from the glide path. The airplane passed the runway threshold at a height of 15 meters (50 ft) and an airspeed of 260 km/h (140 kts).The throttles were moved to the 'idle' position and the airplane touched down at a speed of 230 km/h (124 kts), at a distance of about 900 - 1000 m (2950-3280 ft) from the threshold of the 3060 m (10.040 ft) long runway.The aircraft touched down on the left hand main gear first while the wind was gusting to about 11,5 m/sec. When the nose gear touched down, the right hand undercarriage strut had not yet compressed.Immediately the crew moved the throttle levers to ""maximum reverse"". The thrust reversers did not deploy. Also, the air brakes and spoilers did not deploy automatically.After selecting maximum reverse, thrust was increased to 90% (nominal operation). The minimum speed on landing was 200-205 km/h (108-111 kts). After that the speed increased to 240 km/h (130 kts). The increase in speed led to additional ""unloading"" of the main landing gear. The airplane rolled left and right but there was no simultaneous touchdown of both main landing gears. The pilots used the brakes but they were ineffective because the pressure in the wheel brakes is only applied when both landing gear struts are compressed. Five seconds after switching off the ""maximum reverse"", the flight engineer requested the reversers be activated again. Maximum reverse was selected again with the engines spooling up to 84% thrust. The reversers still failed to deploy. Thirty-two seconds after touchdown the airplane had reached the end of the runway. It crossed the runway threshold at a speed of 215 km/h (116 kts). The flight engineer shut down the engines at the request of the captain. Then both landing gear struts compressed, causing the automatic release of air brakes and spoilers as well as the deployment of the thrust reversers. The distance between the end of the runway and the M3 highway embankment is about 320 m (1050 ft) on downsloping terrain with a sharp dropoff of 10 metres (33 ft) at the embankment. The airplane collided with the embankment at a speed of 190 km/h (103 kts). It broke in three and the forward part of the fuselage came to rest on the highway.It had been snowing prior to the accident and there was a significant cross wind with gusts up to 29 knots. Runway 24 was closed since 19 December according to an airport Notam ""A5127/12 - RWY 06/24 CLSD FOR TKOF AND LDG OF ALL TYPES ACFT. 19 DEC 0630 2012 UNTIL 31 MAR 2359 2013. CREATED 19 DEC 0746 2012""The accident was caused by misadjustment of reverse thrust control units of both engines and incorrect (inconsistent with the airplanes flight manual) control of ground spoilers and thrust reverse by the crew during the landing roll, which prevented proper braking action, causing runway excursion and collision with obstacles at high speed (ca. 190 km/h), destruction of the airplane and death of the crew members. (According to the Manual of Aviation Accident Investigation (ICAO Doc 9756 AN/965, causes and contributing factors are listed in logical order without assessment of priorities).Contributing factors1) Stiffness of the reverse thrust control and locking mechanism that can manifest itself only during improper reverse thrust control by the crew and that is not mentioned in the maintenance manual section covering adjustments after engine change.2) Contradictions between the aircraft and engine maintenance manuals and a continuous neglectful attitude to engine control system checks and adjustments (including the reverser control and locking mechanism) by organizations responsible for engine replacement, making it impossible for aircraft and engine developers to receive feedback and correct flaws.3) Unstabilized approach with significantly exceeded (up to 45 km/h) speed on finals ultimately resulting in a prolonged flare and touchdown 950 m past the designated point.4) Failure of spoilers and speedbrakes automatic deployment due to absence of the simultaneous both main gear Weight-On-Wheels signal caused by initial 'soft' left wheel touchdown (1.12g) in extreme conditions of 11.5 m/s right crosswind.5) Failure of flight crew to verify the automatic spoilers and speedbrakes deployment after touchdown and to deploy them manually.6) Flight manual violation regarding the use of reverse thrust by the crew applying maximum reverse in a 'single input' without setting the lever into intermediate position and failing to verify deployment of the reversers, which in turn led to forward thrust increase due to aforementioned reverse thrust control and locking mechanism flaw.7)  Absence of the simultaneous Weight-On-Wheels signal for both main landing gear struts during the whole landing roll due to specific sensors design (no sensor failure occured; each strut load must exceed 5,5 t) and crews failure to extend spoilers manually that prevented reversers to deploy.8) Captains  unsatisfactory crew management during the whole flight eventually resulting in unstabilized approach and during the landing roll concentration on the reverse thrust engaging leaving other systems unattended.9) Failure to timely implement preventive measures after the 20.12.2012 Tu-204 RA-64049 Red Wings serious incident at Tolmachevo airport.10) Unsatisfactory management level and insufficient safety procedures inside the Red Wings airline, as well as the assigned pilot-instructors neglectful attitude to the captains proficiency check and absence of the proper proficiency check inspection, which in turn made it impossible to determine and eliminate systematic captains piloting deficiencies regarding exceeding approach speed on final, as well as the reverse thrust lever inputs technique after touchdown. Assessment monitoring described in Federal Aviation Rules-128 5.7 had not been performed.11) Absence of the periodical training program concerning standard procedures in case of Weight-On-Wheels sensor failures resulting in failure of spoilers and speedbrakes to deploy. Existing simulators are not capable of modeling this kind of situation.29-12-201229-12-201229-12-201229-12-2012",Ferry/positioning,MAK ,2012

Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA).Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 1119 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying.At 1200 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 1240 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area.This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain.At 1257 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground.A missed approach was initiated at 1310 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20° pitch angle and broke up.CONCLUSION (translated from Russian)The accident with aircraft CRJ-200 UP-CJ006 occurred during the execution of a go-around, in instrument meteorological conditions, without the possibility of visual contact with ground reference points (vertical visibility in the fog did not exceed 40 m), the necessity of which was caused by the mismatch between the actual weather conditions and the minimum conditions for which the crew was certified to land. As a result, the deflection of the elevator towards a dive of the aircraft caused a descent and collision with the ground. It was not possible to uniquely identify the causes of the aircraft's transfer to a dive from the available data. The Commission did not find evidence of failures of aviation equipment, as well as external to the aircraft (icing, wind shear, wake turbulence) when trying to perform a go-around. The most likely factors that led to the accident, were  - partial loss performance of the pilot in command, which at the time of aircraft impact with the ground was not in a working position;  - the lack of CRM levels in the crew, and violation of the Fly-Navigate-Communicate principle, which manifested itself in diverting attention by the co-pilot to conduct external radio communication and lack of control of the flight instrument parameters;  - the lack of response to the EGPWS and the actions required;  - the impact somatographic illusions of perception of the pitch angle (a nose-up illusion);  - increased emotional stress by the crew members associated with the unjustified expectations of improved weather conditions at the time of landing;  - failure to comply with the requirements for health examination of flight personnel, which led to the pilot in command flying without the rehabilitation period and without assessment of his health status after undergoing surgery.29-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-201329-01-2013MAY 2000C-FMLVBombardier11 JUL 2000OY-RJACimber Air07 JAN 2009OY-RJACimber Sterling20 SEP 2012UP-CJ006SCAT",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2013

Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold.It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1.

Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress.The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS- LOCALIZER AT 17NM MRA 3000FT AND AT 25NM MRA 4000FT- GLIDE PATH COVERAGE REDUCED AT 8.5NMThe ATR 72-212 has a demonstrated maximum crosswind component of 35 kts on a dry runway.CAUSES (translated from Italian)The accident is due to the human factor. In particular, it was caused by an improper conduct of the aircraft by the PF (commander) during landing, not consistent with the provisions of the operator's manuals, in an environmental context characterized by the presence of significant criticality (presence of crosswind with values at the limit/excess those allowed for the ATR 72) and in the absence of an effective CRM.The following factors may have contributed to the event.- The failure to carry out the landing briefing, which, in addition to being required by company regulations, would have been an important moment of pooling and acceptance of information fundamental to the safety of operations.- The maintenance of a V APP significantly higher than expected.- The conviction of the commander (PF), deriving from his considerable general and specific experience on the aircraft in question, to be able to conduct a safe landing in spite of the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft.- The considerable difference in experience between the commander and the first officer, which has reasonably prevented the latter from showing his critical capacity, thus rendering CRM techniques ineffective.After the accident, the application of the PEA revealed some critical issues, which did not allow to carry out in a timely and effective manner the search and rescue of the aircraft and its occupants.02-02-201305 NOV 1997F-WWLOATR21 NOV 1997N533ATSimmons Airlines01 MAY 1998N533ATAmerican Eagle01 OCT 2002N533ATExecutive Airlines (American Eagle)30 JAN 2012N533ATExecutive Airlines (American Eagle)09 MAY 2012N533ATExecutive Airlines (American Eagle)21 DEC 2012YR-ATSCarpatair21 DEC 2012YR-ATSAlitalia",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ANSV ,2013

The copilot was Pilot Flying, the Pilot in Command (PIC) was Pilot Monitoring. While en route at FL390 the flight crew listened out the ATIS frequency for Berlin-Schönefeld, but they failed to hear any airport information.After commencing the descent, the flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07L at Berlin-Schönefeld. When passing FL200 in the descent, the Pilot Flying wanted to start the descent checklist, but the Pilot Monitoring wanted to fully listen out the ATIS which was now being received. The ATIS among others stated ""[...] moderate icing reported below 3 000 feet [...]"".At 0851 the Pilot Monitoring stated that the temperature was not below zero Celsius and that he wanted to wait before switching on the anti-ice systems. Four minutes later he switched on the Engine Anti-Ice System as temperature had dropped below zero.At 0857 the flight was cleared to land on runway 07L. When working the Approach checklist, the Pilot Monitoring at the ""icing conditions"" item stated that ""it is still on"".The aircraft was subsequently configured for the final approach and the autopilot was disconnected. The PIC stated that they had visual contact with the runway and that 'everything could be switched off'. He proceeded to switch off the Engine Anti-Ice and Windshield Anti-Ice Systems.As the aircraft was flared over the threshold, the left wing dropped and contacted the runway. The aircraft then rolled right and touched down hard on the right hand main landing gear. The gear leg broke and the aircraft slid along the side of the runway until coming to a stop 447 meters past the runway threshold.A few minutes after the accident, officials noted that a 10 mm layer of ice had accumulated on the aircraft nose, wing leading edge, undercarriage and stabilizer.The PIC stated after the accident that he had not seen any ice accretion on the outer third of the wing and decided not to use the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System. Activating this system would also have reduced aircraft performance.Causes (translated from German)The aircraft accident is attributable to the following causes- The crew performed the approach under known icing conditions and did not switch on the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System, contrary to the standard operating procedures (SOP).- During the flare the aircraft entered a stall due to ice build-up on the wings and tail unit and the fact that the speed fell below the approach speed prescribed for icing conditions, and fell off to the side.Contributing factor- The crew had insufficient knowledge regarding the relationship between the Ice Protection System and the Stall Warning Protection System (SWPS).15-02-2013",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,BFU Germany ,2013

There were 8 crew members and 117 passengers on board. The copilot was Pilot Flying. After an uneventful flight of approximately two hours, the aircraft was established on ILS, for landing on runway 30 at Ponta Delgada Airport. Final approach was performed with both autopilots engaged in LAND mode and Auto Throttle engaged with SPEED mode selected. The aircraft was stabilized on glide slope and localizer, with an approach airspeed Vapp of 132 kts, for a Vref of 126 kts. Descending through 286ft (Radio Altimeter) the autopilots were disengaged. The aircraft was thereafter flown manually, assisted by the use of flight directors and autothrottle.Below 20 feet at a slightly high descent rate there was a short flare followed by a light bounce with spoilers extended. The ensuing aircraft's natural aerodynamic tendency was an increase in the pitch attitude in conjunction with a pulling force exerted on the control column with a high pitch rate (3°/s) and increasing high pitch up attitude (up to 14.82°). This manoeuvre, most likely to avoid a hard nose wheel ground contact, made the tail strike the ground. By the time the main landing gear shock absorbers were fully compressed the aircrafts pitch angle had exceeded the ground/ tail clearance of 13.2°.The aircraft was taxied to the apron and a maintenance preliminary check was performed. The aircraft had sustained serious damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, where the lower skin panels were abraded by contact with the runway surface. In some areas, the skin was buckled through its full thickness and some vertical struts bent the attachment area in the airframe structure.CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENTPRIMARY CAUSEInadequate recovery handling of a bounced firm landing (deviation from recommended flying pilot technique).CONTRIBUTING FACTORSThe following were considered as contributing factorsa) High sink rate prior to and during flare;b) Aircraft firm landing followed by a light bounce;c) Crew momentary unawareness of aircraft position (in the air) and intentional column pulling action, trying to smooth nose wheel contact with ground;d) The presence of a tailwind component during the flare phase above recommended 10kts limits;e) Aircraft's center of gravity at a slightly backward position but this factor is of marginal contribution only;f) The decision to land on damp runway 30, with tailwind component marginal to the maximum permitted (10kts), instead of a circling to land to the actual runway (12) in use or the decision to discontinue the approach via a go-around procedure;g) A bounce recovery at night (with less visual references) characterized by taking place very close to the ground (less than 20 feet) hence allowing for a very short reaction time from the PF and little control effectiveness of the aircraft (throttle retarded and normal configuration to land);h) The existing take-off / landing certification standards, which were based on the attainment of the landing reference speeds, and flight crew training that was based on the monitoring of and response to those speeds, hindering crew to detect degraded landing speed and sink rate.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,GPIAA Portugal ,2013

Both crew members were not injured.Bin Air flight BID-3B originated in Manston International Airport, UK (MSE). The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 10 at Dublin. The approach was a CAT 1 approach. Weather conditions at Dublin were poor with visibility approximately 1,100 metres and a cloudbase of approximately 300 ft. Dublin was operating in low visibility abeyance. Runway Visual Ranges (RVRs) at 0828 hrs were 1,600 m at touchdown, 1,800 m at midpoint and 1.600 m at stopend. The aircraft broke out of cloud at about 650 ft, approximately 200 ft above the minimum for the CAT 1 approach, and the pilots could see three white Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights.As per normal procedure, after landing the First Officer who was Pilot Flying (PF) gave the controls to the captain who was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) so the he (PF) could complete the ""Leaving the Runway"" checklist. This checklist is completed from memory and included booster pump and flap-to-zero selections. The PNF recalled that during the landing roll, while the aircraft was braking and the indicated airspeed was below 90 kts, the nose gear suddenly collapsed. Both propellers contacted the runway surface and the aircraft quickly came to a halt resting on its nose. The Flight Crew then shutdown both engines, requested fire service assistance, selected batteries & generators to OFF and evacuated the aircraft through the cabin door.The Airport Fire Fighting personnel were on the scene within two minutes. There was no fire.The PF reported that it was a foggy day and that the approach was flown on limits with a lot of tension because of the uncertainty as to whether the aircraft would be able to land at Dublin. He described how concerns that fog might roll in raised his stress levels during the approach. During the landing roll, the landing gear selector was inadvertently moved to the UP position. This mistake was immediately recognised and the selector was returned to the DOWN position, but the nose-wheel retraction, which had been initiated, continued. The PF was unable to say definitively why the landing gear selector may have been mis-selected to UP, but he said that the intention may have been to move the Flap Selector instead.PROBABLE CAUSE1. Inadvertent selection of the landing gear selector to the UP position during the landing roll.CONTRIBUTORY CAUSES1. Reduced task focus by the PF following a tense and stressful limits approach.2.

Two of the four persons on board were killed.Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the business flight that departed Tulsa-Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport, OK (RVS), at 1358 CDT.According to preliminary air traffic control information, at 1610, the accident pilot established radio communications with South Bend Approach Control while at 11,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The air traffic controller cleared the flight direct to KNUTE intersection and told the pilot to expect a visual approach to runway 9R. At 1611, the flight was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet msl. At 1613, the flight was cleared to 3,000 feet msl. At 1615, the approach controller told the pilot to make a 5-degree left turn to align with runway 9R and asked the pilot to report when he had the airport in sight. At 161507, the pilot declared an emergency because of a lack of engine power, reporting that they were ""dead stick"" and without any power. About 23 seconds later, at 161530, the pilot transmitted ""we've lost all power, and we have no hydraulics."" When the controller asked if the airplane remained controllable, the pilot replied ""ah, barely controllable."" The controller advised that all runways at South Bend were available for landing and issued the current winds, which were 130-degrees at 10 knots. At 161522, the pilot transmitted that the airplanes navigational systems were inoperative and requested a radar vector toward the airport. The controller replied that the airport was 9 miles directly ahead of the airplane's current position. At 161612, the controller told the pilot to turn 10-degrees left to intersect runway 9R. At 161615, the pilot replied ""26DK, turning left."" No additional voice communications were received from the accident airplane. The approach controller continued to transmit radar vectors toward runway 9R without any response from the accident pilot. At 161858, the approach controller told the accident airplane to go-around because the main landing gear was not extended. (The tower controller had informed the approach controller that only the nose landing gear was extended) The accident airplane was then observed to climb and enter a right traffic pattern for runway 9R. The airplane made another landing approach to runway 9R with only the nose landing gear extended. Several witnesses observed the airplane bounce several times on the runway before it ultimately entered a climbing right turn. The airplane was then observed to enter a nose low descent into a nearby residential community.The airplane came down in a street, crashing into a house near the 1600 block of N. Iowa Street, South Bend. The accident location is approx 1000 metres south of the end of runway 09R.Factual information released by the NTSB suggest that the pilot-rated passenger was allowed to fly the descent under supervision of the captain. The pilot-rated passenger had accumulated 1,576 hours in multi-engine airplanes and 301 hours in single-engine airplanes. He had no experience in turbine-powered business jets. During the descent the captain instructed the passenger to ""just pull the power out"" in order to slow the airplane down. Apparently the passenger lifted the pull-up locks on the throttles and retarded the throttles beyond flight idle, into the fuel cut-off position. The pilot told the pilot-rated-passenger ""you went back behind the stops and we lost power."" During the approach the pilot was able to restart engine number 1.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The private pilot's inadequate response to the dual engine shutdown during cruise descent, including his failure to adhere to procedures, which ultimately resulted in his failure to maintain airplane control during a single-engine go-around. An additional cause was the pilot's decision to allow the unqualified pilot-rated passenger to manipulate the airplane controls, which directly resulted in the inadvertent dual engine shutdown.""17-03-201317-03-201317-03-201317-03-201317-03-201317-03-2013",Executive,NTSB ,2013

One of the two crew members was killed.The airplane was flying to an agricultural field for a crop spraying flight on March 22 when it suffered a loss of engine power. A forced landing was carried out and it was established that the carburettor had failed. The carburettor was replaced and the engine was test run. On March 23 the airplane took off again. Shortly after takeoff the engine lost power. The pilot was forced to ditch the plane in a pond. The airplane flipped over and came to rest inverted in the pond.Probable cause (translated from Russian)The cause of the crash of the AN-2 RA-02203 was a nose-over during a forced landing on the water surface.The emergency landing was caused by falling power and auto shutdown of the engine in flight because of the destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe and carburetor intake valve burnout with the further penetration of exhaust gas with high temperature in the carburetor of the engine input device.The destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe, most probably originated on the mechanism of corrosion under tension in the heating of the material during operation of the engine on automobile gasoline. Power factor that led to the formation of an initial crack most probably were the residual stresses in the material production of origin, arising in the process of making the header pipe.According to the documentation the last overhaul of the manifold was made at 27.01.2009 at Shakhtinskiy RHA DOSAAF. Based on the submitted documents, the Commission has found no evidence of actual repairs on the manifold, as the marking on the only remaining tag indicates that the section was overhauled at plant No. 420GA in October 1983.23-03-2013",Agricultural,,2013

On approach to runway 10, the captain and first officer discussed approach and landing considerations due to the strong crosswinds, and it was decided that the first officer would continue the approach. Immediately prior to landing, the first officer experienced difficulty, so control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain. The transfer of control was completed less than 2 seconds prior to landing. The aircraft touched down on the left main wheel, bounced, and landed hard on the nosewheel; the nose landing gear collapsed due to overstress failures. Directional control was lost, and the aircraft skidded on its nose and came to rest 96 feet off the north side of the runway. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was substantially damaged.The investigation determined that, when control of the aircraft was passed to the captain, there was insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing due to the substantial crosswind. The Air Labrador Twin Otter standard operating procedures (SOPs) do not state when the captain should permit the first officer to act as pilot flying or relieve the first officer from that role. When allowing the first officer to fly in challenging conditions, the captain must be prepared to take control of the aircraft in adequate time to ensure the safety of the flight. Also, there is an increased risk of a landing accident if a required briefing is not conducted. Crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and, as in this case, transfer of control may not be conducted in a timely manner.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The captain permitted the first officer to continue with a challenging approach.2. Control of the aircraft was passed to the captain with insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing.3. The aircraft landed hard, resulting in the collapse of the nose gear due to overstress failures.Findings as to risk1.

29-MAR-2013,Airbus A321-111,SX-BHS,"Hermes Airlines, op.for Air Méditerranée",0,Lyon Saint-E...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20130329-0,Landing (LDG),Minor,Insufficient rest / fatigue Runway excursion,"An Airbus A321-111, registered SX-BHS, experienced a runway excursion after landing at Lyon Saint-Exupéry Airport (LYS). There were no injuries. The airplane operated flight ML7817 from Dakar, Senegal to Lyon, France with an en route stop at Agadir, Morocco.The crew performed an ILS Category 1 (CAT I) approach to runway 36R. The weather conditions are such that operating low visibility procedures (LVP) prevailed.During the transition from the stabilization of height 1000 ft, the aircraft speed was 57 knots greater than the approach speed. At 140 feet, an inappropriate increase in thrust by autothrottles maintained the aircraft at a high speed.The aircraft landed long and the touched down 1600 meters after the 36R threshold. The plane overran at a speed of 75 knots and came to rest about 300 meters beyond the runway end.Causes of the AccidentContinuing an approach below the stabilisation height with a speed significantly higher than the approach speed shows that the crew were not adequately aware of the situation, even though they mentioned several times their doubts on the marginal meteorological conditions and on the difficulties in reducing the aeroplanes speed.Continuing this unstabilised approach at an excessive approach speed triggered, below 150 ft, an uncommanded increase in engine thrust. The crews delayed A/THR reduction below 20 ft made it impossible for the aeroplane to slow down sufficiently for about 15 seconds after passing the threshold.After descending through 20 ft, the copilots inappropriate flare technique and the dual input phenomenon caused by the Captain significantly lengthened the flare phase. The remaining runway distance after the touchdown made it impossible for the aeroplane to stop before the end of the runway.The following factors contributed to continuing the unstabilised approach and the long flare- a flight duty period of nearly 15 hours which likely led to crew fatigue;- incomplete preparation of the approach which meant the crew was not aware of the risks on the day (tailwind, wet runway);- the non-application of ATC procedures that require controllers to ensure aircraft are provided with localiser interception at the latest 10 NM from the runway threshold, with a maximum convergence of 30° and a maximum speed of 160 kt;- partial application of standard procedures (SOP), impaired task sharing and degraded CRM, which meant the crew was unable to manage optimally the aeroplanes deceleration. These factors contributed to a progressive deterioration in situational awareness that meant that they could not envisage rejecting the approach and landing;- the A/THR anomaly which maintained the aeroplane at a high energy level during the landing phase;- an inadequate procedure for taking over the controls that led to the dual input phenomenon.The following organisational factors contributed to the crews poor performance- the choice of flight crew recruitment profiles by the operator, motivated by economic considerations, and inadequate airline conversion, led to operating aeroplanes with crews that were relatively inexperienced on type and in their roles as captain or copilot;- improper and inappropriate application of the regulatory provisions that allow an extension of flight duty time in case of ""unexpected circumstances"" without taking into account the predictable risk of excessive fatigue for the crew;- the absence of suitable initial oversight which made it impossible for the HCAA to focus on the predictable potential operational weaknesses of Hermes Airlines.",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2013

The airplane incurred substantial damage and there were no injuries to the 192 occupants. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. According to flight crew statements, the takeoff, climb, cruise and descent were uneventful. Prior to descent, the captain briefed a visual approach to runway 25L at LAS, which would be backed up by the instrument landing system (ILS). He also included a brief of the A321's 7.5 degree pitch limit.The crew reported that visual meteorological conditions with light and variable winds were initially reported at LAS, however, the winds (VMC) became gusty around the time of the accident. The captain stated that, once he turned off the autopilot while on the approach to runway 25L, he thought ""the winds seemed a little stronger..."" than what was reported, and it felt ""a little squirrelly"".According to the flight crew, the approach was stabilized, on speed, and on glide path. Flaps were selected FULL and autobrakes were selected LOW. The approach speed was 158 knots.When the captain began to initiate the flare within about 20 feet above the ground and pitched up ""just a tad"" for the flare, but stated he did not feel any pitch response, so he brought the nose up a little more to arrest the descent. Upon initial touchdown, he estimated that they bounced about 5-10 feet back into the air and the airplane struck its tail on the second touchdown. Postaccident investigation revealed substantial damage to the underbelly and aft bulkhead area. The skin was abraded over a large area through its thickness in several areas of the pressure vessel .

The descent was continued as the airplane was positioned for an ILS approach to runway 16. At 1734 the tower controller reported the ceiling at the airport to be 200 feet. At that time the captain took over control from the first officer and became Pilot Flying again. At minimums the captain reported seeing the runway and stated, ""continue, in sight."" The airspeed then decreased to below the planned Vapp of 138 knots. At 1737 the airplane passed the threshold at 131 knots. The airplane touched down 155 meters past the threshold at a speed of 136 knots and a vertical gravity of 1,965 g. Pitch angle was 6.7° and touchdown occurred at an angle of attack of 15.5°. The aircraft bounced as thrust was increased, touching down again about 491 meters from the threshold. Pitch angle was 10.9° and the angle of attack was 23.2° with a vertical gravity of 1.715 g. The underside of the tail contacted the runway, causing substantial abrasion damage 100 cm wide and 600 cm long, including wear-through. Eleven interior frames were cracked.The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) determines that the causes of this accident were1) The pilot flying (PF) failed to maintain the proper approach speed until the flare just before touchdown, and the airplane bounced on touchdown since higher-than-normal vertical gravity was applied due to a high sink rate and increased thrust and speed just before touchdown; and2) The airplane made a second touchdown at the pitch attitude exceeding an A321 airplane's limitation and sustained a tail strike since the PF failed to keep thrust at idle and establish the proper pitch attitude during the bounce. Contributing to this accident were1) the inadequate training program dealing with the recovery form the bounce; 2) lack of pre-landing preparation due to a failure to conduct an approach briefing on pitch attitude; 3) the PF's failure to properly allocate his attention due to his delegation of flight control to the pilot monitoring (PM) who failed to meet flight control requirements; 4) the PM's inadequate advice and monitoring due to the PF's failure to make standard callouts; 5) the disconnection of the autothrottle and a failure to manually control thrust and speed; and 6) a failure to execute a go-around when stabilized approach criteria are not met.",International Scheduled Passenger,ARAIB ,2013

Upon entering the operating area about 1229, they encountered a cloud deck partially covering their orbit area and a large, rapidly building towering cumulous cloud in the center of their orbit area from 17,000 ft to 24,000 ft mean sea level (MSL).The towering cumulus clouds began to grow and drift into the airplane's orbit, prompting a request to climb from 20,000 ft to 23,000 ft. This translates to climbing from 13,800 to 16,800 ft above ground level.The airplane was in a left hand orbit, preparing to shift the orbit, when the pilot initiated the climb with the autopilot on at 124040.While or just after initiating the climb, the pilot continued working an orbit adjustment to better service tracking an active target, and approximately ten seconds after the climb was initiated, the climb rate increased. Fifteen seconds afterward the pilot noticed he had allowed the airspeed to decrease during the climb, stating, ""A little slow, correcting."" Seven seconds later, the mission commander in the right hand seat said, ""Alright, firewall,"" meaning to advance the throttles as far forward as they would go, and one second later, the auto-pilot was disengaged.The propellers on the MC-12W do not counter-rotate, and advancing the power in the MC-12W produces left-handed torque and P-factor, creating a left yaw and making the aircraft to want to turn left; the airplane was already in a left-hand turn and left bank. Two seconds after calling to ""firewall"" the throttles, and one second after auto-pilot disengagement, the bank angle warning tone sounded, indicating the left bank had rapidly increased to greater than 50 degrees. The mission commander again called for full power, and four seconds later, he directed ""eyes inside,"" telling the pilot to refer to his instruments for attitude and airspeed information; contemporaneously, the stall warning sounded. The stall warning horn stopped after five seconds, and a second later, background noise indicates items began flying around within the cockpit and the bank angle warning stopped. The pilot stated ""Whoa, pull up"".The mission commander then advised the pilot to look at his airspeed and took over the aircraft, calling for a reduction in power. Four seconds after the mission commander took the aircraft, the aircraft overspeed warning sounded, followed by the landing gear horn sounding. The landing gear horn indicates the throttles were reduced toward idle, and it did not sound until 15 seconds after initial stall warning sounded. The MA reached a maximum recorded height of 20,900 ft. and lost approximately 15,000 ft before impacting the ground.The airplane impacted with the fuselage slightly nose-low, in a left bank, with minimal forward momentum. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and burned during the post-crash fire .CONCLUSION""I find by clear and convincing evidence the cause of the mishap was a stall due to insufficient airspeed, while in a climbing left turn, which developed into a left spin followed quickly by a high-speed spiral, from which the crew was unable to recover. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of evidence, each of the following three factors substantially contributed to the  mishap (1) orbit weather that impeded visibility and masked the horizon; (2) pilot inexperience in the MC-12W; and (3) known MC-12W program risks associated with sustaining required combat capability in theater.""",Military,USAF AIB ,2013

All seven crew members were killed in the accident.The accident flight was operated as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to transport military equipment.The original schedule was for the crew to operate flight NCR510 from Chateauroux, France to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, and then continue to the Dubai World Center at Al Aktoum, UAE. Because no Pakistan over-flight permit was obtained, the flight was re-routed as NCR102 to operate from Camp Bastion to Bagram, refuel, and continue NCR102 from Bagram to Dubai. According to the load manifest, while in Camp Bastion, the airplane was loaded by National Air Cargo ground personnel with 94,119 kg of cargo, including 5 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored military vehicles that were loaded on the main deck of the airplane. Two of these vehicles weighed about 12 tons each, and the other three weighed about 18 tons each.It was the first time National Airlines had transported 18-ton military vehicles when they were loaded on the accident airplane in Camp Bastion.The airplane departed Camp Bastion at 0745Z and arrived into Bagram at 0923Z (1353 local time). On arrival into Bagram, the crew experienced a brake overheat condition after landing on runway 03. The crew parked the airplane on the Foxtrot ramp and ran a checklist to address the brake temperature indications in the cockpit, and discussed the required cooling time of 1 to 1.5 hours. The crew did not take on any additional cargo in Bagram, and only took on fuel for the flight to Dubai. At about 1427 hours local time while the airplane was still on the ramp in Bagram, the captain was made aware of a broken strap found by one of the other crewmembers, and the cockpit crew had a discussion about a possible shift of the cargo load during landing in Bagram.There was additional discussion on re-securing the load prior to departure.Flight NCR102 taxied out normally for departure on runway 03 at Bagram at 1514. After receiving clearance, takeoff was commenced at 1526. The takeoff roll appeared normal. The airplane rotated normally around the Charlie intersection of the runway. Approximately 9 seconds after the crew called to rotate the airplane, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording, and approximately 3 seconds later the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. According to witnesses and video evidence, after becoming airborne, the airplane continued to pitch up until it appeared to stall, turn to the right, then descended to impact with the ground just beyond the departure end of runway 03 and to the right. An investigation of the wreckage revealed at least the aft-most MRAP broke loose of its restraints during takeoff, shifted aft and damaged the FDR/CVR before penetrating the aft pressure bulkhead. The MRAPs aft movement was determined to have compromised at least Hydraulic Systems #1 and #2 and may have contacted the stabilizer jackscrew assembly.PROBABLE CAUSE ""National Airlines inadequate procedures for restraining special cargo loads, which resulted in the loadmasters improper restraint of the cargo, which moved aft and damaged hydraulic systems Nos. 1 and 2 and horizontal stabilizer drive mechanism components, rendering the airplane uncontrollable. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administrations inadequate oversight of National Airlines handling of special cargo loads.""29-04-201329-04-201329-04-201329-04-201329-04-201329-04-201329 JAN 1993F-GISEBoeing10 FEB 1993F-GISEAir France08 SEP 2010TF-NADNational Airlines13 JUL 2011N949CANational Airlines",Cargo,NTSB ,2013

Upon takeoff, a flight control system malfunction, the board found, generated directional instability, causing the aircraft's nose to slowly drift from side-to-side or ""rudder-hunt."" This condition, not fully diagnosed by the crew, progressed into a more dangerous oscillatory instability known as a ""Dutch roll."" The board identified that a poor layout of key information in the inflight manual and insufficient crew training contributed to the mishap by detracting from the crew's ability to act on critical information during their troubleshooting to turn off either of two cockpit switches which may have eliminated the malfunction.Having not recognized the Dutch roll condition, the crew initiated a left turn to remain on-course along the planned route of flight and used a small amount of left rudder to coordinate the turn. The use of rudder, while in a Dutch roll, increased the aircraft's oscillatory instability. The ensuing large side-to-side movements of the aircraft varied the crew member's foot pressure on the rudder pedal which caused inadvertent fluctuations in rudder position. These fluctuating rudder movements, coupled with slight right rudder use while rolling out of the turn, compounded the Dutch roll severity and produced extreme airframe stress that caused the KC-135's tail section to separate from the aircraft.

As the airplane touched down on runway 22, the pilot deployed the spoilers, and then pulled the power levers to the thrust reverser detent position; however, the deploy indicators did not illuminate. He then recycled the thrust levers back into the detent, but again the reversers did not deploy. Both the pilot and copilot attempted to troubleshoot as the airplane continued along the runway. The pilot then applied pressure to the foot pedal brakes, but did not feel a response; the copilot also attempted, but reported that the pedals felt loose and the airplane did not slow down. As the airplane approached the threshold, the pilot engaged the steering lock switch, and attempted to steer the nose wheel, but the airplane did not respond. Just prior to reaching the runway end, he activated the emergency braking lever; however, the airplane rolled off the runway end, through a set of instrument landing system antennas, and down an embankment.Subsequent examination revealed that the mounting screws for both the left and right main landing gear squat switches were loose, such that the switches had backed away from their mounting pads.The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to beFailure of maintenance personnel to reattach the landing gear squat switches following maintenance, which rendered the airplane's steering, braking, and thrust reverser systems inoperative during landing. Contributing to the accident were the failure of both the maintenance facility mechanics and the airplane operator's mechanic and flight crew to identify the error during post maintenance checks, a failure of the airplane's pilot to apply the emergency brakes in a timely manner, and the copilot's decision to attempt to engage the thrust reversers as the airplane approached the runway end despite multiple indications that they were inoperative and producing partial forward, rather than reverse, thrust.13-05-201313-05-2013",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2013

The distribution of tasks, accurate communication and consultation with the manufacturer's manuals could have prevented the accident. c) Education - unspecified It is possible that the captain did not receive adequate training in the operation of the aircraft, but it was not possible to prove the fact that the commander did not receive instruction. d) Piloting judgement - contributed There was no adequate judgement of the crew when it was decided to conduct an approach at a speed higher than recommended by the manufacturer and the touch down beyond the first third runway available.  e) Planning of flight - contributed The weight of the aircraft to near maximum landing weight demanded increasing distance required for landing. f) Low pilot experience - unspecified Limited experience of the pilot in jet aircraft may have contributed to the occurrence. A better understanding into the aerodynamics, using graphics charts to calculate speeds and distances required for landing and simulator training could have been barriers to prevent this accident. g) Management Oversight - unspecified The lack of records of hours flown and inspections for a long period of time, demonstrate inadequate supervision of the responsible operation.

British Airways flight BA762 departed runway 27L on a scheduled service to Oslo, Norway. At that moment, the fan cowl doors from both engines detached, puncturing a fuel pipe on the right engine and damaging the airframe.The symptoms seen by the flight crew included engine thrust control degradation, the loss of the yellow hydraulic system, and a significant fuel leak. After the loss of the yellow hydraulic system the crew declared a PAN, with the intention of returning to Heathrow once they had fully assessed the situation. ATC provided radar vectors for the ILS to runway 27R.During the approach to land, an external fire developed on the right engine. An engine fire warning on the flight deck prompted the crew to declare a MAYDAY. Although both engine fire extinguisher bottles were discharged and the right engine was shut down, the fire was not completely extinguished. The left engine continued to perform normally throughout the flight.The aircraft landed safely and was brought to a stop on runway 27R at Heathrow. The airport fire service attended and quickly extinguished a small fire on the right engine. The passengers and crew evacuated via the escape slides on the left side of the aircraft, without injury.Causal factorsThe investigation identified the following causal factors1. The technicians responsible for servicing the aircrafts IDGs did not comply with the applicable AMM procedures, with the result that the fan cowl doors were left in an unlatched and unsafe condition following overnight maintenance.2. The  pre-departure  walk-around  inspections  by  both  the pushback tug driver and the co-pilot did not identify that the fan cowl doors on both engines were unlatched.Contributory factorsThe investigation identified the following contributory factors1. The design of the fan cowl door latching system, in which the latches are positioned at the bottom of the engine nacelle in close proximity to the ground, increased the probability that  unfastened  latches  would  not  be  seen  during  the pre-departure inspections.2. The lack of the majority of the high-visibility paint finish on the latch handles reduced the conspicuity of the unfastened latches.3. The decision by the technicians to engage the latch handle hooks  prevented  the  latch  handles  from  hanging  down beneath the fan cowl doors as intended, further reducing the conspicuity of the unfastened latches.24-05-201324-05-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2013

Marie Airport, ON (YAM), Canada. There were no reported injuries.Porter Airlines flight 689 was on a visual short final approach to Sault Ste. Marie's Airport runway 30 when power was reduced to correct the descent profile. The aircraft's descent rate quickly increased and was not arrested with power application. The airspeed decreased, causing the approach to become unstabilized.The aircraft landed hard and during the landing flair the pitch angle increased such that the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. There was significant damage to the aircraft skin and structure where it contacted the ground. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Neither crew member identified that the airspeed had dropped below landing reference speed; the flight no longer met the requirements of a stabilized approach, and an overshoot was required.2. The pilot monitoring did not identify the decreasing airspeed and increasing descent rate in time to notify the pilot flying or intervene.3. In response to the pilot monitoring's warning to add power, the pilot flying pitched the nose up beyond the limits stated in the standard operating procedures and the manufacturer's pitch awareness training.4. The high rate of descent coupled with the high nose-up attitude of the aircraft resulted in the hard landing that compressed the struts and allowed the tail to strike the runway.Findings as to risk1. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the requirements for a stabilized visual approach, there is an increased risk that continued flight could result in a landing accident.2.

The captain acted as Pilot Flying and the first officer acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).At 0627 the aircraft departed from Sentani Airport and climbed to the cruising altitude of 12,000 feet. The first officer contacted the Wamena Tower controller at 0701, while the aircraft was approaching Pass Valley point. The controller informed that runway 15 was in use and the weather condition was wind calm, visibility 4 km, low cloud on finals and QNH 1008 mbs. At 0707, the first officer reported they were on final to runway 15.

The aircraft touched down on runway 23 at a point about 30 m before the marked touchdown point (TP) about 190 m from the threshold. The airplane came down on the right-half portion very near the right edge lights. The aircraft continued to the right edge of the runway until the right hand main landing gear fell-off the cemented runway at about 129 m from the touchdown point, followed by the nosegear and the left hand main gear about 511 m from TP. With all landing gears on the soft ground the aircraft rolled for about 330 m more with an indication of trying to return to runway and it momentarily crossed over the concrete entrance taxiway of the parking ramp before it made a full-stop on a grassy area ahead and near the runway, about 845 m from TP. The passengers deplaned via the forward left-hand evacuation slide, which was deployed about fifteen minutes after landing.PROBABLE CAUSE The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable causes of this accident are the following - Pilots lack of event proficiency in low-visibility non-precision approach and landing at night. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Psychomotor skill, recent experience).The PIC as pilot flying Pilot Flying (PF) failed to maintain a stabilized landing approach (under precipitation) until below the MDA so that moments before the touchdown (precipitation becoming heavy), the aircraft was still at left of runway centerline with the FO calling (to align) RIGHT which was done by PF but having lost grasp of the centerline, the correction exceeded the centerline with FO calling ( to correct toward the unlighted center ) LEFT but the aircraft already touched down aligned to the right edge lights that was misconstrued by the PF as the center lights ( based on the repeated expressions of the PF during the landing roll until the aircraft has fully stopped ). - The emergency procedure for go-around was necessary but not utilized. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Learning, Emotion/ Mental Narrowed Attention)The pilot probably was experiencing Narrowed Attention due to apprehension by being acutely conscious of the difficulty ahead ( bad weather ). Added to this was his proficiency status ( one flight to Davao in last 3 months ) and at confusion to notice things in the periphery of his attention i.e., to execute a go-around and make another approach well-prepared on the techniques with lower precipitation level.Contributory Factors - Adverse weather condition. Environmental factor. Natural Environment The weather condition severely affected the judgment and decision-making of the PIC even prior to the approach to land. Heavy rainfall obscured the horizontal visibility of the pilots preventing a clear view of the runway. - Absence of runway center lights. Environmental factor. Man-made Environment (Aerodrome)The PIC misconstrued the edge lights as the runway center lights. Low-visibility approaches require that these lights be present to help guide the pilots toward the runway center. - Inadequate CRM procedures. Human factor. Psychological. (Training) Standard and non-standard call-outs and responses are the hallmarks of an effective cockpit/CRM environment. There were lapses, omissions and contradictory words employed during the landing approach. - Inadequate pilot re-currency training methods. Human Factor. Psychological. (Training) Missed approach procedures during low-visibility non-precision approaches were seldom practiced during the re-currency training of the pilots. The over-use of baseline airports with runway center lights deprived the pilots the opportunity to hone their instrument flying skills in basic airports where they usually operate that has no center lights.- Lack of policy on the advisory role of air traffic controllers ( ATC ). Human Factor. Psychological. (Training) During adverse weather conditions the ATC has no participation in the safety decisions which would require runway closure during critical aerodrome conditions especially in environmental conditions below runway visual minima",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2013

At 172434, when C-GJSU was 2400 feet asl, 7.4 nm away from the runway and on a path toward St-Hubert, the left engine stopped. The pilot initiated a left turn toward the new destination. Over the next 40 seconds, C-GJSU's ground speed dropped from 180 knots to 110 knots.At 172447, the controller provided traffic information to C-GJSU and cleared C-GJSU to the enroute frequency. The pilot acknowledged immediately. There was no further communication by C-GJSU.During the turn, when the aircraft was at the highest point of the turn at 1600 feet asl, the pilot lowered the landing gear. When C-GJSU was 1000 feet asl, the stall warning horn sounded, then sounded 3 more times over the next 10 seconds. When the aircraft was approximately 450 feet above ground level (agl) and 0.85 nm from the threshold of runway 15, the pilot decided to land in a field to the right. Twelve seconds before impact, the pilot warned the maintenance engineer, who was seated in the co-pilot seat, that a forced landing was imminent. At that point, the engineer was not aware that the engines had stopped. The engineer immediately alerted the other 2 passengers that a forced landing was imminent and warned them to hold on tight.Four seconds later, C-GJSU experienced an aerodynamic stall. The right wing touched the ground at an angle of approximately 45°, then the aircraft hit a fence and a tree before severing 2 electrical wires and violently striking the grass-covered ground. The aircraft kept moving for another 120 feet before coming to a stop on its belly. The 4 occupants, who sustained minor injuries, egressed by means of the emergency exit on the right side of the aircraft, which was extensively damaged.Th investigation learned that, while preparing for the flight, the pilot relied exclusively on the fuel gauges, misread them, and assumed that the aircraft had enough fuel on board for the flight. During the flight, the pilot did not monitor the fuel gauges and, when returning to the airport, decided to extend the flight to practice a simulated instrument landing approach, without noticing there was insufficient fuel to complete it.The investigation found the pilot had a history of performance that did not meet expected standards to act as pilot-in-command for that aircraft type. Despite a marginal performance during the check flight, the pilot had successfully passed a pilot proficiency check, and TC had approved the individual's appointment to the position of chief pilot.Meanwhile, the company's operations manager, who had no previous experience in commercial air carrier operations, was unable to fully appreciate the significance of the chief pilot's marginal performance or to detect deviations from regulations in the commercial flights performed over the company's first three months of operations, which preceded the accident. The regulator, Transport Canada, had also approved the appointment of the operations manager.In addition, the investigation revealed that the person responsible for maintenance (PRM), a new co-pilot on the company's BE10, had no previous experience in maintenance or in air taxi flight operations. Transport Canada had also approved the appointment of the PRM.The TSB determined that Transport Canada's appointment approval process was not effective and that, once the appointments had been approved, the management team's inability to perform the duties and responsibilities was not grounds for Transport Canada to revoke them.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The pilot relied exclusively on the gauge readings to determine the quantity of fuel on board, without cross-checking the fuel consumption since the last fuelling to validate those gauge readings.2. The pilot misread the fuel gauges and assumed that the aircraft had enough fuel on board to meet the minimum fuel requirements of the Canadian Aviation Regulations for this visual flight rules flight, rather than adding more fuel to meet the greater reserves required by the company operations manual.3. The pilot did not monitor the fuel gauges while in flight and decided to extend the flight to carry out a practice instrument approach with insufficient fuel to complete the approach.4. The right engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion.5. The pilot did not carry out the approved engine failure procedure when the first engine stopped, and the propeller was not feathered, resulting in significant drag which reduced the aircraft's gliding range after the second engine stopped.6. The pilot continued flying toward Montréal/St-Hubert Airport (CYHU), Quebec, despite having advised air traffic control of the intention to divert to the St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil Airport (CSB3), Quebec, and without communicating the emergency. The priority given to communications resulted in the aircraft moving farther away from the intended diversion airport.7. The left engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion 36 seconds after the right engine stopped, when the aircraft was 7.4 nautical miles from Runway 24R at Montréal/St-Hubert Airport (CYHU), Quebec, and 2400 feet above sea level.8. The pilot's decision to lower the landing gear while the aircraft was still at 1600 feet above sea level further increased the drag, reducing the aircraft's gliding range. As a result, the aircraft was not able to reach the runway at St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil Airport (CSB3), Quebec.9. The operations manager was unable to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position related to monitoring and supervision of flight operations. As a result, the safety of more than half of the flights was compromised.10-06-201310-06-2013",Test,TSB Canada ,2013

Departure time was 1306 hours local time. From the cockpit voice recorder it was evident that the flight crew failed to brief or discuss the weather for departure or enroute. Additionally, they failed to complete several important checklists as required and did not observe sterile cockpit procedures during startup, run-up, taxi and takeoff. The enroute and approach checklists were not conducted prior to arriving near their destination of Marsh Harbour Airport, Bahamas. The crew was aware of the weather conditions at Marsh Harbor, which included heavy rainshowers; however, they never formulated a plan for diversion if the weather was bad at their time of arrival.As the approach continued there were constant disagreements between both pilots as to who had the runway in sight. Due to the weather conditions, visibility of the runway was intermittent, yet the crew continued descending visually in an attempt to land the aircraft on a runway that was not in sight and not served by an instrument landing system (ILS).The crew flew a non-stabilized approach and speed was not constant as they kept increasing and decreasing speed throughout the final approach. The captain, who initially was the non-flying pilot, while on final approach and below 500 feet AGL, assumed control of the aircraft from the flying pilot (first officer). At some point the captain lost use of his windshield wiper as it went over-center and was stuck. During the final moments of the approach. The copilot again assumed control of the aircraft and seconds before touch down, the captain (despite having no visual contact with the runway due to the intense downpour of rain and the non-use of his windshield wiper), again took control of the aircraft from the first officer.By the time the aircraft touched the runway, there were several control wheel exchanges between both pilots while neither had a visual of the runway.The aircraft initially touched down at 174902 with a recorded vertical load factor of +2.16G, approximately 14 seconds after crossing the threshold of runway 09. Upon initial landing however, the aircraft bounced and became airborne, reaching a calculated maximum height of approximately 15 feet AGL.The aircraft bounced a second time at 174907 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.19G. During this second bounce, the pitch attitude was 1.8 degrees nose down, heading 102 degrees magnetic and airspeed 106 KIAS.The aircraft made consecutive contact with the runway approximately three times. The third and final bounce occurred at 174914 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.66G. During the third bounce, the pitch attitude was 2.2 degrees nose down, heading 099 degrees magnetic and airspeed 98 KIAS.As a result of the hard touchdown, damage was sustained to the right wing and right hand engine/propeller. The right hand engine parameters recorded a rapid loss of power with decreasing engine speed and torque, and subsequent propeller stoppage. The aircraft veered off to the right at approximate time of 174920 on a heading of 131 degrees magnetic at a point approximately 6,044 feet from the threshold of runway 09.The recorded airspeed was 44 KIAS with the left hand engine torque at 26 % and the right hand engine torque at 0%. The aircraft came to a full stop at approximate time 174925 on a heading of 231 degrees magnetic. When the aircraft came to a stop, the flight and cabin crew and 21 passengers evacuated the aircraft. The evacuation was uneventful using the main entrance door.CONTRIBUTING FACTORS- Inexperienced and undisciplined crew.- Lack of crew resource management training. - Failure to follow company standard operating procedures.- Condition known as ""get-home-itis"" where attempt is made to continue a flight at any cost, even if it means putting aircraft and persons at risk in order to do so.- Failure to retrieve, observe and respect weather conditions.- Thunderstorms at the airfield.13-06-201313-06-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,AAID Bahamas ,2013

Flight 5J448, departed from Iloilo Airport for its scheduled flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport with 101 persons on board. The aircraft was vectored for ILS approach to land on runway 24. At 1000 ft Radio Altitude the aircraft was stabilized and configured for landing with winds at 140 degrees/9 knots and moderate rain over the field. The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 24 with caution on a wet runway and deteriorating visibility. Before reaching 90 feet RA the wind was calm.From 80 feet RA to 35 feet RA, the wind was already at left cross to tail-cross (left rear quadrant) and at variable direction from 160 degrees - 060 degrees momentary at 013 degrees with wind speed variably increasing from 1 knot to 6 knots. At 70 feet RA, the auto pilot was disengaged and the aircraft was manually flown by the captain until touchdown.From 35 feet RA until before touchdown the wind shifted direction within the left rear quadrant and this time coming from 060 degrees to 112 degrees at increasing speed from 05 knots to 12 knots. Two seconds before touchdown the aircraft's true heading, which was initially at 240 degrees, changed to 230 degrees with groundspeed decreasing to 119 knots, drift angle increasing from +1 degree until +9 degrees just before touchdown. The left cross-tail wind from 122 degrees to 112 degrees showed an increasing wind speed from 16 knots to 22 knots. The aircraft touched down with a heading of 230 degrees, changing further left to heading 220 degrees. Meanwhile the right hand main landing gear hit five runway edge lights with the wheels momentarily treading a portion of soft ground near the right runway edge.At the moment when the nose wheel settled on the ground and the wind speed dissipated to a low of 7 knots, the spoilers and reversers were successfully deployed and the aircraft was steered back to the runway at heading 240 degrees. Lateral control was regained by pilot. Without any ECAM fault indication, the pilot continued taxiing towards Terminal 3 for passenger disembarkation.Maintenance personnel conducted an inspection on the landing gears and discovered several cuts on both right hand tires.PROBABLE CAUSEThe Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probablecause of this accident was- Primary Factora. Inadequate Pilot skill/technique applied on unusual aircraft attitude during landing IFR with unpredicted abnormal wind shift effect. (Human Factor. Psychological. Learning. Motor conditioning)The Pilot was overconfident and dependent on the auto system of the aircraft for adjustment on shifts of wind direction and drift effect and failed to make adequate and effective corrective actions (motor skills/techniques) on the instant changes of wind direction and speed at time just before touchdown.- Contributory Factorsa. Abrupt shifts of wind direction and speed at the critical moments just before touchdown. (Environmental. Natural Environment. Wind condition) The sudden change in wind direction from the left forward quadrant to the left rear quadrant induced aircraft positive drift with late pilot response that resulted in critical skidding of the aircraft to the right with gears momentarily departing the runway pavement. The pilot was overtaken by events in making timely recognition and corrective actions to prevent entering into such dangerous situation.b. Lack of aerodrome advisory on surges of wind. (Environmental. Man-made Environment. Real time wind information)The non-availability of aerodrome information on the developing and shifting wind direction and speed that exceeded aircraft/flight limits resulted in delayed recognition and action by the pilot.-  Underlying Factorsa. Inadequate Training of pilot in the probable critical scenarios at the different ladders of approach and landing. (Human Factor. Psychological. Learning. Motor conditioning)The pilot was overtaken by event during the instantly developed changes and shifts in wind condition during landing and failed to make necessary judgment or application of appropriate motor skill/technique for recovery from such unusual environmental condition.b. Inadequate aerodrome capability to provide real-time wind advisory to aircraft on landing approach. (Environmental. Man-made environment. Aerodrome Weather Radar)The aerodrome capability (radar) needs enhancement to be able to determine surges in aerodrome wind that affect landing flight path especially in the area below MDA and until touchdown and pre-warn/advise pilots on the landing approach. Adequacy of equipment such as LLWR to detect wind shear or microburst and infrastructure support can be looked into.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2013

Both nose and left main gears touched down on the grass patch while the right main gear touched down on the edge of the paved runway. After touching down, the Pilot Flying manoeuvred the aircraft back onto the runway and subsequently taxied the aircraft to its parking bay. As a result of the runway excursion, two signboards on the left of the runway were damaged due to contact by the aircraft. The aircraft sustained damages to its left flaps, left flap track fairings, left landing gear door and left thrust reverser lower clamshell door. There was no injury to any person.CONCLUSION 1. The air traffic controller had informed the flight crew of a low level windshear warning indicating the presence of windshear activity in the aerodrome. As the aircraft approached the runway, the weather conditions deteriorated and this was detected by the aircrafts windshear detection system. 2. The windshear caution was generated by the aircrafts windshear detection system but the visual indication was not noticed by both pilots. When the windshear warning was generated later, the PF did not notice the visual and aural indications related to this warning and the PM noticed only the aural indication. 3. Although the PM heard the aural warning, he did not initiate a go-around, which was required by the Airplane Flight Manual.",Private,AAIB Singapore ,2013

The take-off mass of the aircraft then exceeded the maximum take-off mass by at least 150 kg.At 1745 local time, the aircraft rolled onto a grassy area parallel to runway 16 and began taking off with a 15° flap position.The pilot said that he felt that the engine's performance was slightly below normal, but considered it justified by the high outside temperature (33-34°C). After becoming airborne the pilot noticed increasing engine vibrations. He turned to the left to avoid the high-voltage power line ahead. Altitude at that time was 3 meters. In order to increase lift, he raised the flaps to 20° and then to 25°, but he continued to lose height during the turn. The left wing tip hit a corn field, followed by the undercarriage. The aircraft nosed down and came to rest. The collision caused the engine to run out of lubricating oil, which caused a fire. The fire was extinguished by the pilot using a hand fire extinguisher.There was no personal injury and the aircraft was severely damaged.Cause (translated from Hungarian)- The turn the pilot attempts at low altitude and low speed under the circumstances.Indirect causes- high ambient temperatures,- the static load on the airplane at its maximum permissible level,- dust filter switched on unnecessarily,- unjustified use of carburettor heating,- increase propeller angle in the given flight position,- reducing engine power in the given flight position by taking back the throttle.19-06-2013",Agricultural,TSB Hungary ,2013

Each flight, typically about 3 minutes long, consisted of scooping water from Moosehead Lake, dropping the water on the fire, and then returning for another water scoop. All flights were made with the PROBES AUTO/MANUAL switch in the AUTO selection. The switch was left in this position at the end of these flights.At about 1400 on the day of the accident, the flight crew were deployed to the same forest fire that they had been working on the day before. The captain was the pilot flying (PF) for the occurrence flight and occupied the left seat. The captain removed the centre pedestal cover during the pre-flight preparations. The first officer, who was the pilot not flying (PNF), completed the exterior walk-around and carried out the pre-flight cockpit checks.The aircraft had 7000 pounds of fuel and 1000 pounds of chemical foam on board. Utilizing this information, the water-drop control computer determined the maximum quantity of water to be scooped. The flight crew considered the wind speed and direction and decided to follow the same practice as the previous day and scoop water from Moosehead Lake.After takeoff, the PNF was required to complete the ""After Takeoff"" checklist, and in preparation for scooping water, to complete the ""Water Bombing in Range"" and ""Pick-up"" checklists.About 4 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft touched down about 1250 feet from the eastern shore of the lake, on a heading of 250°. The PF then applied takeoff power, and the PNF began adjusting the torque limit stops. Throughout the scooping run, the PNF was focused on ensuring that the soft stops were set as per the PF's instructions.While adjusting the soft stops, the PNF noted that the water tanks were completely full, and advised the PF that the probes were still down and the PROBE AUTO/MANUAL switch was in the MANUAL selection. The PNF then manually selected the probes up. The probes retracted about 3490 feet after touchdown.The flight crew continued the takeoff despite indication by the water status display panel that water quantity was in excess of that allowable for this takeoff.At the time the probes were retracted, the aircraft was about 2500 feet from the departure-end shoreline of the lake. The PF determined that the aircraft would require a greater distance to become airborne and initiated a left turn to follow the lake. About 2 seconds later, the aircrafts hull began to lift out of the water, and the left float contacted the water.For the next 4 seconds, aileron and rudder control surface deflections commanded a left turn; however, during this time, the aircraft was skidding to the outside of the turn. The float remained in contact with the water, and the aircrafts hull was completely out of the water. The PF deflected the elevators up to near full deflection, with no corresponding response in pitch attitude, and then initiated a right turn using ailerons, with no response to this input.About a second later, the aircrafts hull was about 7 feet above the water, with the float still in contact with the water. The float separated from its pylon, resulting in a sudden pitch-down moment.The forward section of the hull collided with the water, causing the lower part of the forward fuselage to tear open. The right wing float collided with the water, causing complete separation of the right float and pylon. The aircraft came to rest upright, with the cockpit partially underwater. The flight crew briefly delayed their evacuation until the propellers had stopped rotating.The PNF retrieved a life vest and evacuated the aircraft through the overhead escape hatch. Once on top of the aircraft, the PNF donned the life vest. The PF could not retrieve a life vest and exited the aircraft through the left-side sliding window.The flight crew remained on the wing as the aircraft continued to sink. The PNF contacted company personnel by cellular telephone and advised them of the situation. Within about 30 minutes, Department of Natural Resources employees arrived by boat and transported the flight crew to shore.The aircraft settled on the lake bottom, about 225 feet from the southern shore of the lake.Neither pilot attempted to remotely activate the emergency locator transmitter (ELT), shut down the engines or select electrical power OFF.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. It is likely that the PROBES AUTO/MANUAL switch was inadvertently moved from the AUTO to the MANUAL selection when the centre pedestal cover was removed.2. The PROBES AUTO/MANUAL switch position check was not included on the Newfoundland and Labrador Government Air Services CL-415 checklist.3. The flight crew was occupied with other flight activities during the scooping run and did not notice that the water quantity exceeded the predetermined limit until after the tanks had filled to capacity.4. The flight crew decided to continue the take-off with the aircraft in an overweight condition.5. The extended period with the probes deployed on the water resulted in a longer take-off run, and the pilot flying decided to alter the departure path to the left.6. The left float contacted the surface of the lake during initiation of the left turn.

06-JUL-2013,Boeing 777-28EER,HL7742,Asiana Airlines,3,San Francisc...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20130706-0,Landing (LDG),Destroyed,Insufficient rest / fatigue Undershoot/overshoot,"A Boeing 777-200 passenger jet, operated by Asiana Airlines, was destroyed in a landing accident at San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO). There were 291 passengers and 16 crew members on board. Three passengers died and 48 were seriously injured.Flight OZ-214 originated in Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN), South Korea were it departed at 1635 local Korean time. Destination of the flight was San Francisco, CA. The weather at San Francisco was fine with 6-7 knot winds and a visibility of 10+ miles. The pilot undergoing initial operating experience was in the left hand seat as Pilot Flying. An instructor pilot was sitting in the right hand seat. The relief first officer was in the jump seat at the time of the approach.The pilot flying had logged about 9700 flying hours. Flight 214 was his tenth flight leg on a Boeing 777 while undergoing initial operating experience.The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 28L, the ILS glidepath of which had been declared unserviceable in the current Notam.The airplane was configured for landing with 30 degrees of flaps and gear down. Target threshold speed was 137 knots. According to preliminary information from the cockpit voice recorder, the crew did not state and anomalies or concerns during the approach. The throttles were at idle and autothrottle armed. At 1600 feet the autopilot was disengaged. The aircaft descended through an altitude of 1400 ft at 170 kts and slowed down to 149 kts at 1000 feet.At 500 feet altitude, 34 seconds prior to impact, the speed dropped to 134 kts, which was just below the target threshold speed. The airspeed then dropped significantly, reaching 118 knots at 200 feet altitude. The instructor pilot reported that he noticed four red PAPI lights and concluded that the autothrottle had not maintained speed.Eight seconds prior to impact, the throttles were moved forward. Airspeed according to the FDR, was 112 knots at an altitude of 125 feet. Seven seconds prior to impact, one of the crew members made a call to increase speed. The stick shaker sounded 4 seconds prior to impact. One second later the speed was 103 knots, the lowest recorded by the FDR. One of the crew members made a call for go a around at 1.5 seconds before impact. The throttles were advanced and the engines appeared to respond normally. The main landing gear and rear fuselage then struck a sea wall, just short of runway 28L. Airspeed was 106 knots. The empennage separated at the rear bulkhead. The airplane then ballooned, yawed left and spun 360 degrees before it came to rest to the left of runway 28L, 735 m (2400 ft) from the seawall.A post impact fire occurred when a fuel tank ruptured inboard of the no. 2 engine, spilling fuel on the hot engine, causing it to ignite.The ILS glidepath for runway 28L and 28R at SFO had been declared unserviceable from June 1 until August 22.PROBABLE CAUSEThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew's delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were; (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the flight crew's nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) flight crew fatigue which likely degraded their performance.06-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-201306-07-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2013

After passenger and crew disembarkation, the aircraft was towed to Stand 592, next to a fire station along taxiway E. Ground power was switched off.Approximately at 1634 an employee in the air traffic control tower noticed smoke emanating from the aircraft and activated the crash alarm. The Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) arrived on scene at 1635 and discharged water and foam onto the outside of the aircraft. One fire fighter removed the power umbilical cables from the aircraft as a precaution. Fire fighters equipped with breathing apparatus entered the aircraft at 1537 via the L2 door and encountered thick smoke. As they moved to the rear of the aircraft the smoke became denser so they opened further cabin doors to clear the smoke. At the rear of the passenger cabin they observed indications of fire in a gap between two overhead luggage bins. They were unable to use a hose-reel as the gap was too small and discharged a handheld 'Halon' extinguisher through the gap, about 20 minutes after entering the cabin. This was ineffective, so they removed some ceiling panels to expose the area and to get better access. At this point a small amount of flame was visible. This was extinguished with several pulses of water spray from their hose-reel, about 25 minutes after entering the cabin. A thermal-imaging camera was used to identify affected areas requiring further cooling. Investigation showed that the fire was initiated by the uncontrolled release of stored energy from the lithium-metal battery in the ELT. The ELT battery wires, crossed and trapped under the battery compartment cover-plate, probably created a potential short-circuit current path which could allow a rapid discharge of the battery. Neither the cell-level nor battery-level safety features were able to prevent this single-cell failure, which then propagated to adjacent cells, resulting in a cascading thermal runaway, rupture of the cells and consequent release of smoke, fire and flammable electrolyte.The trapped battery wires compromised the environmental seal between the battery cover-plate and the ELT, providing a path for flames and battery decomposition products to escape from the ELT. The flames directly impinged on the surrounding thermo-acoustic insulation blankets and on the composite aircraft structure in the immediate vicinity of the ELT. This elevated the temperature in the fuselage crown to the point where the resin in the composite material began to decompose, providing further fuel for the fire. As a result of this a slow-burning fire became established in the fuselage crown, which continued to propagate from the ELT location at a slow-rate, even after the energy from the battery thermal runaway was exhausted.The following causal factors were identified in the ground firea)	A thermal runaway failure of the lithium manganese dioxide battery in the ELT resulted in the uncontrolled release of stored energy within the battery cells.b)	The location and orientation of the ELT, and the compromised seal on the battery cover-plate, allowed the resulting hot gas, flames and battery decomposition products to impinge directly on the aircrafts composite fuselage structure, providing sufficient thermal energy to initiate a fire in the rear fuselage crown.c)	The resin in the composite material provided fuel for the fire, allowing a slow-burning fire to become established in the fuselage crown, which continued to propagate from the ELT location even after the energy from the battery thermal runaway was exhausted.d)	The Navigation Radio System safety assessment conducted in support of the ELT certification, did not identify any ELT battery failure modes which could represent a hazard to the aircraft, and therefore these failure modes were not mitigated in the ELT design or the B787 ELT installation.The following factors most likely contributed to the thermal runaway of the ELT batterya)	The trapped ELT battery wires created a short-circuit condition, providing a current path for an unplanned discharge of the ELT battery.b)	The ELT battery may have exhibited an unbalanced discharge response, resulting in the early depletion of a single cell which experienced a voltage reversal, leading to a thermal runaway failure.c)	The Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) protective device in the battery did not provide the level of external short-circuit protection intended in the design.d)	There was no evidence that the reset behaviour, and the implications of the variable switching point of the PTC, had been fully taken into account during the design of the ELT battery.e)	The absence of cell segregation features in the battery or ELT design meant the single-cell thermal runaway failure was able to propagate rapidly to the remaining cells.12-07-201312-07-2013",-,AAIB ,2013

The pilot in command and 9 passengers were on board the airplane, and the second in command was outside on the right side of the airplane; adjacent to the passenger door and ventral stairs. A passenger in the last row of the airplane asked the second in command to assist her with her seatbelt, at which time the second in command climbed up the stairs into the airplane. At the same time, the gate agent removed the tail stand from the airplane, without communicating with the flight crew.A passenger in row 3 then stood up to hand a carry-on bag to the second in command so that it could be stowed in the cargo compartment.

The five persons on board suffered minor injuries.At 0403 hours local time the Sukhoi Superjet took off from runway 20 at Keflavík Airport for flight testing with a crew of five on board. The airplane had been undergoing certification flight tests for almost one month at Keflavík Airport. This was the crew's fourth test flight since their work shift started at 1800 the day before. The pilot flying was sitting in the right cockpit pilot seat.Seven approaches and go-arounds were performed with possible landing gear touchdown to runway 20, followed by two to runway 11. During the final approach to runway 11 at 0522, the landing gear was selected down. The approach was normal. At 0523 the flight crew initiated the 9th test of the flight. The purpose of the test was to simulate a CAT IIIA automatic approach, close to the airplane's maximum landing weight limit, while in crosswind exceeding 10 m/s (19.5 knots), with a critical engine failure occurring at radio altitude of 25 feet, resulting in a low pass/missed approach. When the aircraft was at radio altitude of about 10 ft the flight certification expert sitting in the jump seat in the cockpit shut down the right engine using the ENG MASTER SWITCH. After the right engine was shut off, the right autothrottle disconnected and the right throttle lever stopped moving to idle, while the left autothrottle continued moving the left throttle lever back to idle.At a radio altitude of about 4 feet the pilot flying disengaged the autopilot. This caused disengagement of all autopilot/flight director control modes and the left autothrottle reverted to SPEED mode. When the left autothrottle reverted to SPEED mode, the left throttle lever had already reached IDLE. At that time the airplane speed had reduced down below the ""limit selectable speed"", so the left autothrottle started moving the left throttle lever forward.The pilot flying pressed the TOGA (Take Off/Go Around) button on the right throttle lever to initiate a goaround. Almost simultaneously the main landing gear touched the runway.The left engine autothrottle and flight director then disengaged automatically. The pilot flying then noticed at the primary flight display that the go-around mode had not engaged when he selected the TOGA switch. The pilot flying also noticed that the flight director was not available and that the autothrottle was switched off. The pilot flying then started to perform a go around in manual mode, setting the right (inoperative) engine throttle lever to TO/GA, pitched-up the aircraft and ordered landing gear retraction.During the go-around procedure, after the landing gear was retracted, the airplane started to loose speed. The airplane stopped climbing having reached a maximum radio altitude of 27 feet at and then started to descend. The speed decreased further, below 120 knots. The pilot flying then set the right throttle lever to MAX. The speed continued to decrease and the pilot flying, now aware of both the speed loss and the loss of altitude, reduced the nose pitch to try to counteract stalling.The airplane's aural warning ""LANDING GEAR NOT DOWN"" triggered at that time.The pilot flying realized that engine was not in takeoff mode and checked engine power settings. He found out that operating left engine was in N1=50% mode and realized that he had been controlling the inoperative engine.The pilot flying set the left engine throttle lever to MAX. The airplane was still descending and while the left engine was spooling up, the airplane hit the runway.As the landing gear was in the up position, it was the fuselage aft lower belly that hit the runway first. This was on the left side of the runway center line, as due to the loss of airspeed and the crosswind the airplane had drifted to the left.This was followed by the engines' cowlings touching the runway. As the airplane nose had been turned into the wind when it hit the runway, it initially veered to the right, as it skidded down the runway, across the runway centerline. The pilot flying counteracted this movement with a left rudder input and steered the airplane back towards the runway centerline.The pilot flying set both throttle lever's to IDLE position at and then to deploy the thrust reversers. The airplane skidded off the end of runway 11 and came to rest after having passed 163 meters beyond the threshold of runway 29.After the airplane had come to a stop, the pilot in command, who was also the pilot flying, ordered an emergency evacuation. The forward left door was opened by the cockpit crew, but the emergency escape slide did not deploy. The crew member operating the test equipment in the cabin opened the rear left door and its slide deployed. The cockpit crew then opened the forward rightdoor. The slide deployed, but due to the crosswind it blew underneath the belly of the airplane and was unusable. The whole crew evacuated the airplane via the rear left door.The Icelandic Transportation Investigation Board determined that the most probably cause of the accident to be flight crew fatigue, which resulted in the flight crew advancing the incorrect throttle lever to TO/GA position. This occured after the airplane touched the runway, which had resulted in the automatic flight control system shutting off.21-07-2013",Test,TSB Iceland ,2013

Of the 144 passengers and 5 crewmembers on board, 8 sustained minor injuries, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The flight had departed from Nashville International Airport (BNA), Tennessee, about 1433 central daylight time. The first officer was the pilot flying (PF) for the trip to LGA, and a pilot from another airline occupied the cockpit jumpseat. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. As the airplane was on final approach, the captain, who was the pilot monitoring (PM), realized that the flaps were not configured as had been briefed, with a setting of 40 degrees for the landing. The captain set the flaps to 40 degrees as the airplane was descending through about 500 ft altitude, which was about 51 seconds from touchdown. When the airplane was between 100 to 200 ft altitude, it was above the glideslope. Concerned that the airplane was too high, the captain exclaimed repeatedly ""get down"" to the first officer about 9 seconds from touchdown. About 3 seconds from touchdown when the airplane was about 27 ft altitude, the captain announced ""I got it,"" indicating that she was taking control of the airplane, and the first officer replied, ""ok, you got it."" After the captain took control, the control column was relaxed to a neutral position and the throttles were not advanced until about 1 second before touchdown. The airplane touched down at a descent rate of 960 ft per minute and a nose-down pitch attitude of -3.1 degrees, resulting in the nose gear contacting the runway first and a hard landing. The airplane came to a stop on the right side of the runway centerline about 2,500 ft from its initial touchdown.The operator's stabilized approach criteria require an immediate go-around if the airplane flaps or landing gear were not in the final landing configuration by 1,000 ft above the touchdown zone; in this case, the flaps were not correctly configured until the airplane was passing through 500 ft. Further, the airplane's deviation about the glideslope at 100 to 200 ft would have been another opportunity for the captain, as the PM at this point during the flight, to call for a go-around, as indicated in the Southwest Airlines Flight Operations Manual (FOM).PROBABLE CAUSE ""The captain's attempt to recover from an unstabilized approach by transferring airplane control at low altitude instead of performing a go-around.

The repositioning flight departed Reykjavik at 1244 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170.During cruise, the flight crew discussed the captain's wish to deviate from the planned route to, in order to fly over a racetrack area near the airport. At the racetrack, a race was about to start at that time. The commander had planned to visit the racetrack area after landing.The aircraft approached Akureyri from the south and at 10.5 DME the flight crew cancelled IFR. When passing KN locator (KRISTNES), the flight crew made a request to Akureyri Tower to overfly the town of Akureyri, before landing. The request was approved by the tower and the flight crew was informed that a Fokker 50 was ready for departure on runway 01. The flight crew of TF-MYX responded and informed that they would keep west of the airfield. After passing KN, the altitude was approximately 800 ft MSL. The co-pilot mentioned to the commander that they were a bit low and recommended a higher altitude. The altitude was then momentarily increased to 1000 ft.When approaching the racetrack area, the aircraft entered a steep left turn. During the turn, the altitude dropped until the aircraft hit the racetrack. The left wing touched the ground and the airplane broke up while impacting terrain at Hlíðarfjall Road, northwest of Akureyri Airport. A post-impact fire erupted.Causal factors- A breakdown in CRM occurred.- A steep bank angle was needed to line up with the racetrack.- The discussed flyby was executed as a low pass.- The maximum calculated bank angle during last phase of flight was 72.9°, which is outside the aircraft manoeuvring limit.- ITSB believes that the commander's focus on a flyby that he had not planned thoroughly resulted in a low-pass with a steep bank, causing the aircraft to lose altitude and collide with the ground.Contributory factors- The commander's attention to the activity at the race club area, and his association with the club was most probably a source of distraction for him and most likely motivated him to execute an unsafe manoeuver.- Deviations from normal procedures were seen to be acceptable by some flight crews.- A flyby was discussed between the pilots but not planned in details.- The flight crew reacted to the departing traffic from BIAR by bringing their flight path further west of the airport.- The approach to the low pass was misjudged.- The steep turn was most probably made due to the commander's intention to line up with the race track.05-08-2013",Ferry/positioning,TSB Iceland ,2013

All crew members escaped.The aircraft, UR-CAG, arrived as flight UKL751 at Leipzig at 1914 on August 8, after a flight from Stockholm, Sweden. The airplane parked at Stand 207. Loading operations commenced at 2330 and were finished at 0100. The cargo consisted of almost 49,000 day old chickens, weighing 3061 kg. The airplane was then fueled with 22,908 litres of fuel for the flight to Mineralnye Vody Airport (MRV), Russia. Fueling was completed at 0121. Planned departure time was 0215. At 0201 the controller at Leipzig cleared the crew to start the engines. The APU was started, followed by the no. 1 engine. During the starting process of engine no. 4, the crew heard a muffled bang and the airplane jerked. The co-pilot, who was monitoring the instruments during the starting process, had observed variations in APU speed and an increase in temperature. Immediately the APU fire warning flashed. The crew shut down both engines and activated the fire-extinguishing system of the APU.A flight mechanic then opened the emergency hatch located below the flight deck and observed the fire in the area of the APU. Other crew members handed him three fire extinguishers that were located on the flight deck. The flight engineer and two flight mechanics then proceeded to the fire and emptied the extinguishers. The captain meanwhile instructed the radio operator to warn the tower controller about the fire. The controller was contacted at 0207. He activated the fire alarm at 020800 and reported the location of the fire at 0209. The first crash tender reached the airplane at 0212 and began an attempt to put out the fire.By then all crew members had evacuated through the emergency exit below the flight deck. The airplane burned out.Due to the high degree of destruction it was not possible to determine the exact cause of the fire. It is possible that the compressor wheel had burst.Conclusions ""The fire originated in the APU and propagated rapidly to the cargo compartment. The fire was not contained within the APU chamber. The propagation and severity of the fire were aided by the leaking fuel from the fuselage bottom tanks and the burning light metal alloy components of the APU.""09-08-2013",Cargo,BFU Germany ,2013

Both pilots were killed.Flight 1354 departed Louisville International Airport, KY (SDF) about 0504 hours EDT on a regular cargo service to Birmingham (BHM).The flight was on approach to runway 18 when it struck trees. The airplane contacted terrain and crashed in a field, 1000 m short of the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crews continuation of an unstabilized approach and their failure to monitor the aircrafts altitude during the approach, which led to an inadvertent descent below the minimum approach altitude and subsequently into terrain. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crews failure to properly configure and verify the flight management computer for the profile approach; (2) the captains failure to communicate his intentions to the first officer once it became apparent the vertical profile was not captured; (3) the flight crews expectation that they would break out of the clouds at 1,000 feet above ground level due to incomplete weather information; (4) the first officers failure to make the required minimums callouts; (5) the captains performance deficiencies likely due to factors including, but not limited to, fatigue, distraction, or confusion, consistent with performance deficiencies exhibited during training; and (6) the first officers fatigue due to acute sleep loss resulting from her ineffective off-duty time management and circadian factor.14-08-201314-08-201314-08-201314-08-201314-08-2013",Cargo,NTSB ,2013

Passengers were processed through the Buffalo Airways terminal, where they checked in and dropped off their checked luggage. Passengers and their baggage were not weighed at the check-in counter. After the aircraft had been loaded, 4 last-minute passengers were boarded along with their luggage.At the time of departure, the operational flight plan (OFP) was partially completed and did not reflect the number of passengers on board or the weight of the cargo. The crew did not receive a cargo manifest prior to departure.At 1708, BFL168 received take-off clearance from the Yellowknife tower controller and initiated the take-off run from runway 16 at the intersection of runways 16/34 and 10/28. The runway distance available from the intersection was approximately 5956 feet.At 1710, the tower controller observed heavy torching and smoke from the right engine and called to advise BFL168 of this observation. The tower controller received no response from BFL168. The crew of BFL168 was in the process of retracting the landing gear when a fire was observed in the right engine. An emergency engine shut down was performed, which included feathering the right propeller. As the right propeller was moving towards a feathered condition, it stopped feathering before reaching the full feathered position and returned to windmilling. BFL168 made a low-altitude right turn in an attempt to reach runway 10. The maximum height achieved by BFL168 was approximately 180 feet above ground level (agl).While manoeuvring, BFL168 struck a stand of trees, about 30 feet in height, 690 feet southwest from the threshold of runway 10. The initial point of ground contact was 400 feet beyond the trees. BFL168's wreckage trail was parallel to and south of runway 10 and was about 330 feet in length. The landing gear and the flaps were in the retracted position. Due to the relatively low-energy impact, the emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate.Once the aircraft came to a complete stop, the flight attendant initiated the evacuation of the 21 passengers through the left-aft door. The flight attendant returned to the aircraft and moved some galley drawers that were blocking the cockpit, and confirmed that the flight crew was safe. The 3 crew members subsequently evacuated the aircraft. ARFF sprayed the aircraft with fire retardant foam as a precaution. The crew and passengers, none of whom were injured, remained at the site under the supervision of ARFF for approximately 60 minutes. They were subsequently transported back to the Buffalo Airways terminal building.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. An accurate take-off weight and balance calculation was not completed prior to departure, resulting in an aircraft weight that exceeded its maximum certified take-off weight.2. The right engine number 1 cylinder failed during the take-off sequence due to a pre-existing fatigue crack, resulting in an engine fire.3. After the right propeller's feathering mechanism was activated, the propeller never achieved a fully feathered condition likely due to a seized bearing in the feathering pump.4. The windmilling right propeller caused an increase in drag which, combined with the overweight condition, contributed to the aircraft's inability to maintain altitude, and the aircraft collided with terrain short of the runway.5. The operator's safety management system was ineffective at identifying and correcting unsafe operating practices.6. Transport Canada's surveillance activities did not identify the operator's unsafe operating practices related to weight and balance and net take-off flight path calculations. Consequently, these unsafe practices persisted.Findings as to risk1. If companies do not adhere to operational procedures in their operations manual, there is a risk that the safety of flight cannot be assured.2. If Transport Canada does not adopt a balanced approach that combines inspections for compliance with audits of safety management processes, unsafe operating practices may not be identified, thereby increasing the risk of accidents.3. If cockpit or data recordings are not available to an investigation, this may preclude the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety.19-08-201319-08-2013",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2013

The landing gear hydraulic motor pump automatically shut down when the landing gear was not locked down after 16 seconds and an internal mechanical lock intended to hold the landing gear actuator in the selected position, did not engage.The crew carried out the abnormal procedures checklist and attempted to extend the left MLG using the manual landing gear extension procedures, but was unsuccessful. The crew then prepared for landing in accordance with the procedures contained in the quick reference handbook for landing with main gear up or unsafe.As the airplane slowed through about 80 knots on the landing roll, the left main landing gear collapsed.Post-accident inspection indicated hydraulic fluid had leaked from a hole, which was normally plugged with a Lee plug, on the left main actuator between the primary and secondary extend ports. The Lee plug was missing and was not found. Examination of the actuator and of the hydraulic fluid quantity remaining indicated the Lee plug was in place during the in-flight attempts to extend the landing gear.The airplane landed with the gear not locked down and as the landing gear collapsed, the piston in the actuator forced hydraulic fluid back through the system increasing the landing gear actuator internal hydraulic pressure sufficiently to force the Lee plug out of position.

Power was lost and the captain decided to perform a forced landing on moorland. The airplane nosed down into a swamp.Cause (translated from Russian)Most likely cause of the accident with the An-2 RA-33017 was the use of substandard car fuel, low-octane, presence of mechanical impurities (rust), which led to an increase in the temperature of the cylinder heads, drop in engine power, unintentional reduction of altitude and the need to perform a forced landing on the wetland. Contributing factors could be - poor organization of storage, refueling and fuel quality control on site; - wrong decision by the captain to perform the flight when detecting that the fuel deviated from the norm (color, texture, presence of mechanical impurities).18-09-201318-09-2013",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2013

The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and this was his first flight to Deauville.The flight crew prepared for an ILS approach for landing on runway 30 as the ATIS information indicated that this was the runway in use. This subsequently changed to runway 12. On first contact with the Deauville Approach controller at 1007, the crew was informed that the active runway had changed and that another aircraft was preparing to take off ahead of them. The controller suggested a runway 12 GNSS approach. However, the flight crew was not qualified for GNSS approaches. The crew radioed that they were preparing for a visual approach, but they prepared for a circle-to-land procedure. When the controller requested to report downwind, the PF interpreted this message as an instruction to turn right. From that point on, the crew no longer followed standard procedures but mixed the circle-to-land procedure and visual the approach. The flight descended to the MDA of 1100 ft AAL during the downwind leg and then continued the descent into the last turn under the glidepath for the final. At 101844, the TAWS ""terrain ahead"" alarm sounded for about eight seconds. The PF reacted by initially applying a pitch-up command. The aircraft attitude changed from 0.5° to 12° nose-up. At 101852, a second ""Terrain ahead pull up""-alarm sounded for approximately seven seconds. At this time, the aircraft was at a minimum recorded altitude of 528 ft (49 ft above the aerodrome) and 3 NM from the runway threshold. The PF reacted by reapplying a further pitch-up command. The attitude of the aircraft increased towards 16°. The aircraft climbed again and the crew regained visual contact with the runway and realized that they were to the left of the centreline. As the aircraft, still climbing, approached the coast, the PF began a turn to the right. The controller saw the aircraft in an unusual attitude and asked ""One nine eight five, you are going around ?"".The crew responded that they were landing. The Tower controller then radioed ""Cleared to land, zero seven zero degrees, five to eight knots."" The aircraft passed over the glide path indicated by the PAPI lights. At about 1.5 NM from the threshold and at an altitude of 1,144 ft, the PF resumed the descent, decreasing the attitude to -1° to nose-down, and began the last left turn by banking the aircraft to 33° to align with the runway centreline. A TAWS ""sink rate"" alarm was then triggered for approximately three seconds. The PF then contacted the controller, stating ""Onurair one nine eight five, (*) request circle to land for runway three zero, we are not able to land in 12 now.""The captain then explained on the frequency that they lost visual contact with the runway because of the sun. He requested and obtained clearance for a visual approach to runway 30.The read back of the controller's clearance was done by the PF and PNF simultaneously.The aircraft passed over the runway at a height of 300 feet. The crew retracted the flaps to position 3 and the PF began a right turn after passing the Deauville Airport. The aircraft climbed to a height of 1100 feet on a heading of 150 degrees and then began a left turn to align on runway 30. At the end of the turn, the crew selected the flaps in the full extended position and the TAWS glideslope alarm activated for approximately two seconds. At 102328, the aircraft landed on runway 30.The controllers did not observe the aircraft's track on final. A TAWS warning caused the crew to climb to a safe altitude from which they continued the approach.Causes of serious incidentThe crew announced a visual approach on the radio but prepared for an MVL procedure. When the controller requested the crew to call back at the beginning of the downwind leg, the PF interpreted this message as an order to turn right. From this point on, the crew no longer followed a standard procedure but mixed up the MVL procedure with the visual approach procedure. They descended to the MDA (1,100 ft AAL) in the downwind leg and then continued the descent in the final turn under the final approach slope. The minimum recorded altitude was 528 ft (i.e. 49 ft above the aerodrome) at a distance of 3 NM from the runway threshold.The serious incident was caused by- an incomplete transition from the MVL procedure to the visual approach procedure. The crew kept the MDA as their target altitude in the downwind leg;- a loss of awareness of the aircraft's situation in the vertical plane. The crew commenced and continued the descent under the final approach slope. However, when flying over the sea, crews may have a tendency to fly too low because the external visual references are insufficient to accurately estimate height;- the crew and the ATC represented the flight path which the aircraft was to follow to reach the downwind leg differently. The controller expected a flight path corresponding to a visual approach while the crew initiated an MVL procedure.The controllers did not watch the aircraft's flight path on the final approach. The crew's response to the occurrence of TAWS alerts probably prevented a collision with the coast.",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2013
27-SEP-2013,DHC-8-402Q Dash 8,9A-CQC,Croatia Airlines,0,Zürich-Klote...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20130927-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Gear-up landing Runway mishap,"A DHC-8-400 passenger plane, operated by Croatia Airlines, was damaged in a nose gear-up landing at Zürich-Kloten Airport (ZRH), Switzerland. None of the 64 occupants were injured.Croatia Airlines flight OU464 departed Zagreb-Pleso Airport (ZAG) at 1746 on a regular flight to Zürich. The flight was uneventful until the approach to Zürich. The flight had been cleared for an ILS approach for a landing on runway 14.At about six nautical miles from the threshold, the first officer lowered the landing gear lever to the DOWN position. Subsequently, the flight crew heard a loud and repetitive sound, which was described as being ""like a rubber hitting a metal"". The flight crew was under the impression that two components were hitting each other in the nose landing gear bay. The flight crew then checked the landing gear indication lights on the instrument panel. Both main landing gear indication lights were green, indicating a down and locked position. The nose landing gear indication showed a discrepancy between the landing gear control lever and the landing gear position.At this point, the flight crew decided to discontinue the approach and informed air traffic control accordingly. Immediately, Croatia 464 was ordered by ATC to climb straight ahead to 4000 feet QNH. A holding pattern for troubleshooting was offered by ATC and accepted by the flight crew. At 1939 flight 464 entered the holding pattern at FL90.Since the alternate landing gear extension procedure was not successful, the flight crew then went on with consulting the airplane manufacturer's flight operations service letter (FOSL) concerning issues with the landing gear. The problem persisted.The flight crew finally decided to perform the landing at Zürich Airport with the nose gear in the retracted position.At 2018, the airplane touched down on runway 14 with its main landing gear. As the airplane was decelerating, the nose was lowered and the airplane came to a complete stop 540 meters after the forward lower fuselage had come into contact with the runway surface.During the technical investigation of the airplane by the Swiss Accident Investigation Board, the nose gear weight on wheel (WOW) cover plate was found squeezed between the lower and the upper drag strut of the nose landing gear. The WOW cover plate had previously fractured at the lower left and right lug enabling the pivoting of the plate upwards.CausesThe accident is attributable to the fact that the flight crew was not successful in extending the nose landing gear and then had to conduct a landing with extended main landing gear and retracted nose landing gear.The following factor was identified as the direct cause of the accident- The WOW [weight on wheels] cover plate on the nose landing gear was broken on both lower lugs so that it was bent upwards around the upper tab mounts and was trapped in the nose gear mechanism, which prevented the extension.The crack on the lower WOW cover plate lug is attributed to the following factors- The way the WOW cover plate was mounted led to lateral forces on the WOW cover plate and mechanical stress in the area of the upper and lower lugs during operation of the nose landing gear steering.- There were weld defects in the area of the lower lugs.27-09-201327-09-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,STSB Switzerland ,2013

Flight 063 departed Madrid, Spain on a regular passenger flight to Rome-Fiumicino. While on approach to runway 16L at Rome-Fiumicino Airport at 2010 the crew attempted to lower the undercarriage. A Master Warning sounded and the ECAM showed a message ""L/G GEAR NOT DOWNLOCKED"". The crew carried out a missed approach procedure and entered a holding pattern at the Campagnano VOR. A g-force manoeuvre was carried out with the landing gear lever down. This resulted in a maximum value of 1.75g, according to DFDR data. When this attempt failed, they tried to recycle the landing gear and later again a gravity extension, but all measures were unsuccessful.Consequently, the crew requested an emergency landing at Rome-Fiumicino Airport. The aircraft touched down on runway 16L at 21.01with the right landing gear only partially extended. The flight crew shut down both engines just before touchdown. The subsequent evacuation was uneventful and there were no injuries.CAUSES (translated from Italian)The cause of the event is attributable to the failure of the right hand undercarriage actuator. In the same, there was a hydraulic block caused by multiple debris found within the actuator itself (as well as in the hydraulic fluid), presumably in the restrictor zone. The origin of this debris was identified in the material from the two elements called ""spirolox ring"" and ""damping rings"" found missing from their design position.This failure seems to result in a defect in the design of the ""spirolox ring"", the effect of which has resulted in premature deterioration and subsequent fall of the same element, resulting in internal damage found during the actuator analysis.",International Scheduled Passenger,ANSV ,2013

The airplane impacted the ground near the airport fuel depot and broke up. A fire erupted. There were 20 people on board the plane. Seven occupants initially survived the accident. Three later died in hospital.Associated Aviation flight SCD-361 was on a chartered flight from Lagos to Akure, Nigeria. The airplane was carrying the body of a former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Agagu, for burial in Akure.At 0907 hours local time, start-up of the aircraft was granted by the controller. Engine no.2 was started first, followed by engine no.1. At this point, the crew observed that the No. 1 engine torque indicator was stuck at 76% which prompted the Pilot Monitoring (PM) to conduct an Electronic Engine Controls (EEC) test; however, the indicator remained at 76%. The PM invited the engineer who was a crew member, into the cockpit to ascertain the job done on the EEC. The job done could not be determined as the engineer reported he was not part of the team that worked on the aircraft. The engineer then requested that the PM test the EEC, but the PM responded that this had already been done several times previously. Nonetheless, the PM repeated the EEC test.At 0920 the PM requested taxi clearance from Lagos Tower. The flight was cleared to taxi to the holding point for runway 18L. During the taxi, the crew continued with further discussions on the state of the aircraft without briefing or referring to any document. Considering that the No. 1 torque indicator remained stuck at 76%, the crew decided to set power using T6.At 0926 SCD361 was cleared to Akure on airway A609, climb Flight Level 190, squawk 0504 and to line-up and wait. SCD361 acknowledged. The flight crew agreed to perform a flapless take-off ""again"", if the flap configuration warning came on. At 0928 the Tower controller re-cleared SCD361 to route via airway R778, Flight Level 190. The crew carried out the ""Cleared into position"" checklist. At about 0929 flight 361 was cleared for takeoff on runway 18L; wind was calm. Approximately 4 seconds after engine power was advanced to commence the takeoff roll, the crew received an automated aural warning ""Takeoff Flaps.. Takeoff Flaps."" as the flaps had not been set for takeoff. The copilot noted that the aircraft was moving slowly. Four seconds later, the aural warning sounded ""Takeoff Flaps.. Auto feather."" The flight data recorder shows that at this time the right hand engine appeared to be producing considerably less thrust than the left engine.The no. 2 prop had feathered and during the takeoff the fire handle for that engine was activated.Some 12 seconds after announcing the '80 knots' call the first officer asked if the take-off should be aborted. Airspeed at the time would have been about 95 knots. The captain indicated that they should continue. The crew did not make a V1 or Vr call. During the rotation, the first officer stated ""gently"". The First Officer indicated that the aircraft was not climbing and advised the captain who was flying not to stall the aircraft. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft slowly veered off the runway heading to the right and was not climbing properly. Ten seconds after rotation the stall warning sounded. An aerodynamic stall occurred and the airplane impacted the ground in a nose down near 90 degree right bank attitude.Causal Factori. The decision of the crew to continue the take-off despite the abnormal No. 2 Propeller rpm indication.ii. Low altitude stall as a result of low thrust at start of roll for take-off from No. 2 Engine caused by an undetermined malfunction of the propeller control unit.Contributory Factorsi. The aircraft was rotated before attaining V1.ii. The decision to continue the take-off with flap configuration warning and auto- feather warning at low speed.iii.

On board were 11 crew members and 203 passengers.The aircraft landed at Manila  about 2300 following an uneventful flight. The aircraft parked at Bay 43 of Terminal 2 at 2305 hours. The doors were opened and the flight crew allowed passengers to deplane and cargo to be offloaded.At about 2325 when the checklist for securing and parking the aircraft was completed, the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) warning indicated smoke in the aft cargo hold. Then, the rear cabin crew heard crackling sounds and later noticed smoke coming from the rear of the cabin. One of the rear cabin crew rushed to the cockpit and personally relayed to the captain that there was smoke in the rear of the cabin. At this point, the captain with the FO went out of the cockpit and verified the smoke. The captain went back to the cockpit alone, and discharged the fire extinguishing bottles for the aft cargo compartment and then went out of cockpit. After a while, upon remembering that the battery was already off, the captain returned to the cockpit, put on the battery and repeated the firing of the fire extinguishing bottles for the aft cargo compartment.After this, at about 2355 the captain departed the aircraft since the cause and source of the smoke was undetermined.When the aft cargo door was opened there was thick smoke and hot air pushing out. The cargo loader immediately moved away from the aft cargo door and returned to close the door.Fire services attended to suppress the fire and smoke. Then the cargo loaders unloaded the Unit Loading Devices (ULDs) that were affected by fire. Initial investigation conducted showed that out of six ULDs in the aft cargo compartment for baggages and cargoes, there were four ULDs affected by the fire. The aft cargo compartment showed substantial damage by fire.PROBABLE CAUSEThe Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable causes of this accident are the following- The inadvertent mixing of dangerous substances glycerin and potassium permanganate initiated the incipient fire in aft cargo compartment.The incipient fire at the aircraft Aft Cargo Compartment was triggered by inadvertent mixture of spilled contents of individual small containers of dangerous substances containing potassium permanganate and glycerin contained in luggages of passengers who were Kayak athletes placed at aft cargo compartment.Contributory Factor- Inadequate system of identifying contents of checked-in passengers baggages that contain dangerous goods.The check-in baggages contain amounts of dangerous goods and other chemicals that when inadvertently spilled and made contact with each other will initiate fire. These dangerous goods in small quantities were not adequately covered by manual/psychological and technology inspection/monitoring at the aircraft point-oforigin and when not well-secured in luggages provide the probability of inadvertently mixing while on flight.- Inadequate proficiency of pilot in the timely implementation of the procedures for Aft Cargo Compartment Smoke Warning.The PIC upon indication of smoke warning after aircraft ""on block"" failed to immediately execute Level 3 procedure which include triggering of fire extinguishing bottles and call out for support from airport fire fighting capabilities.Underlying Factor- Inadequate passenger information and airport security procedure on the identification and control of the updated list of dangerous goods and its safety handling.The passengers are under informed on the safety aspects of handling or avoiding transport of dangerous goods. Likewise, airport security personnel still need dynamic update in training and equipage to closely inspect/monitor its transport by air.07-10-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,,2013
10-OCT-2013,DHC-6 Twin Otter 310,9M-MDM,MASwings,2,Kudat Airpor...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20131010-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Turbulence Loss of control,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 310, operated by MASwings, sustained substantial damage in an accident at Kudat Airport (KUD), Malaysia. The copilot and one passenger died, four others were injured.MASwings flight MH3002 operated on a domestic flight from Kota Kinabalu Airport (BKI) to Kudat. The captain was the pilot flying for this sector and the first officer was pilot monitoring. As the aircraft was approaching Kudat Airfield, Kudat Tower reported the weather conditions to be wind at 270 degrees at 17 kts gusting 31 kts.The aircraft continued the approach on runway 04 and leveled off at 500 feet with flaps set at 10°. At this point the crew noticed that the approach for runway 04 had a strong tail wind. This was evident from the indicated airspeed observed by the crew which indicated 100 kts where the airspeed for flaps 10° should be 65kts. The windsock also indicated a tail wind. Noticing the approach for runway 04 was a tail wind condition, the crew decided to go around at a height of 500ft.Maintaining runway heading, the crew initiated a go around climbing to 1,000ft making a left tear drop and reposition for runway 22. On the approach for runway 22 the captain informed the first officer that if they could not land they would return to Kota Kinabalu.The aircraft was aligned with the centerline of runway 22 and 20° flaps was set. The aircraft continued to descend to 300ft. At this point the wind appeared to be calm as the aircraft did not experience any turbulence and the captain told the first officer that he was committed to land. Upon reaching 200ft the captain called for the flaps to be lowered to full down.As they were about to flare the aircraft to land, approximately 20ft above the runway, the aircraft was suddenly hit by a gust of wind which caused the aircraft to veer to the right with the right wing low and left wing high and the nose was pointing 45° to the right of runway 22.The crew decided to go around by applying maximum power; however the aircraft did not manage to climb successfully. The flaps were not raised and were still in the full flaps down position as the crew thought the aircraft was still low hence the flaps were not raised. The aircraft continued to veer to the right with right wing low and managed to only climb at a shallow rate. The aircraft failed to clear the approaching trees ahead and was unable to continue its climb because the airspeed was reducing. The presence of a full flaps configuration made it more difficult for the aircraft to climb. As the aircraft was on full power on both the engines, it continued to fly almost perpendicularly in relation to the runway and at a low height above the ground.The aircraft hit a tree top at the airfield perimeter fencing, disappeared behind the row of trees, hit another tree behind a house.It hit the right rear roof of the house, ploughed through the roof top of the kitchen, toilet and dining area, hit the solid concrete pillars of the car garage and finally hit the lamp post just outside the house fence. It swung back onto the direction of the runway and came to rest on the ground with its left engine still running. A woman and her 11-year old son who were in the living room at the time escaped unhurt.CONCLUSIONSBased on the information from the recorded statements of witnesses and Captain of the aircraft, it clearly indicates that the aircraft was attempting to land on Runway 04 with a tail-wind blowing at 270° 15kts gusting up to 25kts on the first approach, contrary to what was reported by the Captain to the investigators. The demonstrated cross wind landing on the DHC6-310 is 25kts and tailwind landing is 10kts. The aircraft was unsettled and unstable until it passed abeam the terminal building which was not the normal touch down point under normal landing condition.The flap setting on the first approach with the tail-wind condition was at 10°, which is not in accordance with companys procedures. A tail wind landing condition that will satisfy the criteria for the DHC6-310 is not more than 10kts tail-wind and a flap setting of not more than 20°. One of the stabilized approach criterias for visual conditions (VMC) into Kudat is landing configuration must be completed by 500ft Above Ground Level (AGL) for the DHC6-310 where else if the above conditions could not be met, a go-around should be initiated.Hence, the Crew should have initiated a go-around earlier before the aircraft reached 500ft AGL on the first approach. The aircraft should be in the correct landing configuration at or below the stabilized approach altitude of 500ft AGL, since the aircraft was not stable due to the tail wind and gusting weather. The procedure carried out on the approach for Runway 04 was not consistent with MASwings Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for a tailwind condition. Nonetheless, the first approach for Runway 04 though was uneventful.On the second approach from Runway 22, the wind condition was still not favorable for landing, and gusting. The aircraft was believed to be slightly low on the initial approach and was still unstable. The flap setting for the second approach for Runway 22 was at full flap (37°). As the wind was gusting, a flap setting to full-down should be avoided for the landing as stated in companys DHC6-310 SOP. With the full-flap configuration, the aircraft had difficulty to settle down on the runway thus dragging the aircraft until abeam the tower which is way beyond the normal touch down zone.At the point where the aircraft was approaching to land it was reported that the aircraft was hit by a sudden gust, several factors, including the following, have been looked intoa) Why was the aircraft unable to climb after initiating the go-around?The full flap setting would require a zero degree pitch attitude to ensure the aircraft speed is maintained. With go-around power set, the zero degree pitch would ensure a climb without speed loss. A pitch above zero degree can cause the aircraft speed to decrease and induce a stall condition resulting in the aircraft being unable to climb.b) Was the go-around technique executed correctly, taking into consideration that the wind was blowing from 270° and gusting? The Captain had said that ""I applied maximum power and expected the aircraft to climb. At this point, the aircraft was still in left-wing high situation. I noticed the aircraft did make a climb but it was a shallow climb. I did not retract the flaps to 20°, as at that time, in my mind, the aircraft was still low."" c) Under normal conditions, the rule of thumb for initiating a go-around procedure is to apply maximum power, set attitude to climb, confirm airspeed increasing and reduce the flap setting. This procedure was found not to be properly synchronized between MASwings Manuals and DHC6-310 Series 300 SOP.d) Were the pilots in control of the aircraft?Based on the Captains statement and other associated factors, the pilots were not in total control of the aircraft.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB Malaysia ,2013

All 44 passengers and five crew members were killed in the accident.Flight QV301 originated in Vientiane, Laos at 1445 and operated a domestic service to Pakse. Weather in the area was poor as a result of a passing typhoon. The flight was cleared for a VOR-DME non-precision approach to runway 15. After passing the final approach fix, the procedure called for a descent to the minimum descent altitude of 990 feet. After this the approach may only be continued if ground visual references are available.The crew however incorrectly set the altitude preselect (ALT SEL) mode to 600 feet. This was still below the (incorrectly) published height of 645 feet on their Jeppesen chart.Since the ground was not visible at 600 feet, the crew disconnected the autopilot and aborted the approach with the intention to conduct a missed approach. After the aborted approach, the Flight Director vertical mode switched to Go Around and immediately went into altitude capture mode because the altitude selected was 600 feet. The missed approach was followed by a right turn instead of a nominal climb as published in the VOR-DME approach chart. The airplane began losing altitude.A series of EGPWS warnings sounded and the height reached the minimum value of 60 feet above ground level and the roll reached approximately 37° to the right. When the flight crew realized that the altitude was too close to the ground, the captain over-reacted, which led to a high pitch attitude of 33°. The Flight Director command bars then disappeared from the screen because of the extreme aircraft position.The airplane climbed to an altitude of 1750 feet until the airplane pitched down again. The Flight Director command bars then reappeared and centered during the descent, because the selected altitude was still 600 feet.The descent was continued until the airplane impacted the Mekong River. The fuselage broke and sank in the river.Causes of the AccidentThe probable cause of this accident were the sudden change of weather condition and the flight crew's failure to properly execute the published instrument approach, including the published missed approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft impacting the terrain.The following factors may have contributed to the accident- The flight crew's decision to continue the approach below the published minima- The flight crew's selection of an altitude in the AL T SEL window below the minima, which led to misleading FD horizontal bar readings during the go-around- Possible Somatogravic illusions suffered by the PF- The automatic reappearance of the FD crossbars consistent with the operating logic of the aeroplane systems, but inappropriate for the go-around- The inadequate monitoring of primary flight parameters during the go-around, which may have been worsened by the PM's attention all tunneling on the management of the aircraft flap configuration- The flight crew's limited coordination that led to a mismatch of action plans between the PF and the PM during the final approach.16-10-201316-10-201316-10-201316-10-201316-10-201316-10-201316-10-201316-10-2013",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIC Laos ,2013

Both occupants were killed.The airplane was owned by California pastor Ed Dufresne of the World Harvest Church. He was on board the flight that departed Wichita-Mid-Continent Airport, KS (ICT) at 0959, destined for New Braunfels Regional Airport, TX.After climbing to and leveling at 15,000 feet, the airplane departed controlled flight, descended rapidly in a nose-down vertical dive, and impacted terrain; an explosion and postaccident fire occurred. Evidence at the accident site revealed that most of the wreckage was located in or near a single impact crater; however, the outer portion of the left wing impacted the ground about half a mile from the main wreckage. Following the previous flight, the pilot reported to a maintenance person in another state that he had several malfunctioning flight instruments, including the autopilot, the horizontal situation indicator, and the artificial horizon gyros. The pilot, who was not a mechanic, had maintenance personnel replace the right side artificial horizon gyro but did not have any other maintenance performed at that time. The pilot was approved under an FAA exemption to operate the airplane as a single pilot; however, the exemption required that all equipment must be operational, including a fully functioning autopilot, flight director, and gyroscopic flight instruments. Despite the malfunctioning instruments, the pilot chose to take off and fly in instrument meteorological conditions. At the time of the loss of control, the airplane had just entered an area with supercooled large water droplets and severe icing, which would have affected the airplane's flying characteristics. At the same time, the air traffic controller provided the pilot with a radio frequency change, a change in assigned altitude, and a slight routing change. It is likely that these instructions increased the pilot's workload as the airplane began to rapidly accumulate structural icing. Because of the malfunctioning instruments, it is likely that the pilot became disoriented while attempting to maneuver and maintain control of the airplane as the ice accumulated, which led to a loss of control.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The airplane's encounter with severe icing conditions, which resulted in structural icing, and the pilot's increased workload and subsequent disorientation while maneuvering in instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions with malfunctioning flight instruments, which led to the subsequent loss of airplane control.

During taxi at Port Moresby, the anti-skid warning light illuminated. The flight crew stopped the aircraft, carried out the relevant checklist, and determined from the aircraft performance charts that it was permissible to land at Madang with the anti-skid inoperative. The flight to Madang was normal and the aircraft landed there at 0732. While on the ground, the freight from Port Moresby was off-loaded and a cargo consisting entirely of cigarettes, packaged in large cardboard cartons, was loaded for Tabubil and Port Moresby.The aircraft taxied to depart from runway 25 at 0915. The flight crew used the full length of the runway and the takeoff roll was normal until the Pilot-in-Command, who was the handling pilot, tried to rotate at VR (which the flight crew had calculated to be 102 knots). The controls felt very heavy in pitch and he could not pull the control column back in the normal manner. After approximately two seconds the Pilot-in-Command aborted the takeoff and selected full reverse thrust, and he later applied full braking. It was not possible to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway and it continued over the embankment at the end of the runway and the right wing struck the perimeter fence. This caused the aircraft to yaw to the right and it entered a creek beyond the perimeter fence at approximately 45 degrees to its direction of movement. The aircraft came to rest in a small creek, with the forward 4/5 of the fuselage in the water and the cockpit mostly submerged. The right outboard wing section caught fire and the flight crew escaped through the hatch in the cockpit roof. The Pilot-in-Command, who was the last to remain on board, discharged the fire extinguishers in each engine and switched off the battery master switch before leaving the aircraft.The investigation found that the aircraft total load exceeded the maximum permissible load and the load limit in the forward cargo zone A exceeded the zone A structural limit. The mass and the centre of gravity of the aircraft were not within the prescribed limits.The weight for cargo compartment A as calculated by the pilots for the weight and balance of the aircraft should have been 350 kg. However, this was exceeded by 786 kg.The maximum (permissible) all up weight was 16,900 kg. The Load Chart listed the MAUW accepted by the PIC as 16,606 kg. However, the actual total cargo weight was 597 kg heavier than listed on the load sheet, therefore, the aircraft was 343 kg heavier than the permissible MAUW.Contributing factorThe investigation found that Air Niuginis lack of robust loading procedures and supervision for the ATR 42/72 aircraft, and the inaccurate weights provided by the consignor/client company likely contributed to the overload.Other factorsa) The Madang Airport fire-fighting tender vehicle did not have sufficient capacity to fight a more extensive aircraft fire involving an aircraft larger than the ATR 42.b) The Madang Airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to the required aerodrome category 6, for rescue and fire-fighting services.c) The Madang Airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to the runway end safety areas.d) The Madang Airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standards with respect to the required Airport Emergency Plan.19-10-201319-10-201319-10-201319-10-201319-10-2013",Cargo,AIC PNG ,2013

However, this switch was blocked. The captain looked out the window and observed that the fire had stopped and the left engine was partially missing. The plane remained controllable and the crew turned back and landed without any further problems at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. The forward portion of the left engine and the multi-split propeller were found in a field beneath the initial climb centreline of runway 09R.Fatigue failure of the blade rootThe no. 2 propeller blade root on the left engine failed due to fatigue, resulting in separation from the propeller hub and then interaction with the no. 1 blade and its disconnection from the propeller hub. The imbalance created by the loss of these two blades led to the front part of the engine being torn off.The cause of the fatigue cracking could not be determined with certainty.The following may have contributed to the fatigue fracture of the propeller blade root- insufficient preloading of the propeller, increasing the stress exerted on it. The lack of maintenance documentation made it impossible to determine the preload values of the bearings during the last general overhaul;- the presence of manganese sulphide in a heavily charged area of the propeller. The presence of this sulphide may have generated a significant stress concentration factor, raising the local stress level.The tests and research carried out as part of this investigation show that the propeller blade root is made of a steel whose microstructure and composition are not optimal for fatigue resistance. However, the uniqueness of the rupture more than 50 years after commissioning makes it unlikely that the rate of inclusions, their distribution, size, or sulphur content of the propeller is a contributing factor in the accident.",Cargo,BEA ,2013

The pilot, accompanied by the search director, and three observers, gathered at the aircraft's base at Guernsey Airport, and made preparations for flight. There was no moon and the Channel Islands were affected by poor weather, with strong southerly winds, low cloud, and poor visibility. The aircraft took off at 1847 hrs and, taking account of the cloud base and visibility, the pilot levelled the aircraft at approximately 700 ft amsl on track towards the search area.When the aircraft was approximately six miles north of Jersey Airport, the right engine rpm began to vary, repeatedly reducing and then increasing. The observer seated to the right of the pilot, observed the fuel pressure fluctuating but this was not noticed by the pilot. The pilot selected the alternate intake air but the engine then stopped. The pilot feathered the propeller and then completed the engine shutdown checks. Following a brief conversation with the search director, the pilot turned the aircraft towards Jersey Airport and declared a MAYDAY to ATC, while the search director made a similar call on the maritime frequency. The pilot applied full power on the left engine and put the aircraft into a climb.The aircraft had climbed to approximately 1,100 ft amsl when the left engine rpm began to fluctuate before the engine ceased to produce power. The pilot informed ATC that the aircraft was ""going down"" and the search crew stowed their equipment. No attempt was made to re-start either engine.An offshore lifeboat operating nearby changed its course to be in attendance should the aircraft ditch. As the aircraft descended, the radio altimeter issued an alert prompting the pilot to switch on the landing lights and instruct the crew to brace. As it continued its descent the aircraft's landing lights suddenly illuminated ground ahead and the pilot manoeuvred for a touchdown.The north coast of Jersey is characterised by rocky cliffs and roughly undulating terrain, however, the aircraft's descent brought it towards one of the very few relatively benign areas suitable for a forced landing.

Both pilots and three of the five passengers were killed in the accident. Flight 311 was a scheduled flight between Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, with stops in Sioux Lookout, Ontario, and Red Lake, Ontario. The flight from Thunder Bay and the subsequent departure from Sioux Lookout were uneventful. At 1816, Winnipeg ACC cleared Bearskin 311 to the Red Lake Airport for the VOR/DME runway 26 approach, and advised the pilots to contact Kenora Flight Service Station (FSS).The descent checklist was carried out and, at 1817, the crew advised Kenora FSS that they had been cleared by Winnipeg ACC for an approach to runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport. Because the crew were expecting to encounter visual conditions prior to landing, a full approach briefing was not carried out.The landing checklist was completed and, at 1827, the crew advised Kenora FSS that they were 5 nautical miles (nm) on final approach for runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport. At 1828, at approximately 500 feet above ground level and approximately 1.4 nm from the runway, the crew noted an aircraft malfunction but did not immediately identify the nature of it. Maximum power was applied to one or both engines, and the landing gear was initially selected up and then re-selected down before it could fully retract. The crew declared an emergency with Kenora FSS and unsuccessfully attempted to initiate a climb. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft veered and rolled to the left, descended, and struck trees with its left wing. The aircraft continued through the trees and struck a series of hydro lines that ran parallel to Ontario Highway 125, before coming to rest in a wooded area adjacent to the highway.A post-crash fire erupted.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. A first-stage turbine wheel blade in the left engine failed due to a combination of metallurgical issues and stator vane burn-through.2. As a result of the blade failure, the left engine continued to operate but experienced a near-total loss of power at approximately 500 feet above ground level, on final approach to Runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport.3. The crew were unable to identify the nature of the engine malfunction, which prevented them from taking timely and appropriate action to control the aircraft.4. The nature of the engine malfunction resulted in the left propeller being at a very low blade angle, which, together with the landing configuration of the aircraft, resulted in the aircraft being in an increasingly high drag and asymmetric state. When the aircrafts speed reduced below minimum control speed (VMC), the crew lost control at an altitude from which a recovery was not possible.Findings as to risk1. If pilots believe that the negative torque sensing (NTS) system in the SA227 aircraft will activate in the event of any power loss or that NTS activation alone can provide adequate anti-drag protection in the event of an engine power loss, there is a risk that flight crews operating these aircraft types may not initiate the Engine Failures In Flight checklist in a timely manner.2. If there is no requirement for a boroscope inspection of the TPE331-11U-612Gs internal engine components in conjunction with the 450-hour fuel nozzle inspection, there is an increased risk that premature internal engine damage will not be detected.3. If there are discrepancies between the fuel nozzle testing procedures described in the TPE331-11U-612G maintenance manual and the corresponding fuel nozzle overhaul manual, there is a risk that unserviceable fuel nozzles may be evaluated as serviceable and re-installed on aircraft.10-11-201310-11-201310-11-2013",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2013

This was, as a triggering factor, due to a significant change in operating weather conditions within a very short period of time, at one of the most critical moments in the operation of an aircraft, and without the crew receiving any information from the ATC about the change or becoming aware of it.The combination of the following factors contributed to the track excursion.- Tailwind component of 27 kt, greater than the limitation prescribed by the manufacturer (15 kt on dry runway); rain with reduced visibility, and runway contaminated with water.- The ATC did not update the weather information to the crew, who were unaware of the sudden and significant change in conditions.- The Ezeiza flight control tower does not have an alarm system in the event of a sudden change in surface wind conditions.- Destabilized approach from the disconnection of the AP and the transition to visual flight.- Monitoring and call outs by the PM in the event of FP deviations that did not comply with the operator's SOPs.- Failure to consider the approach procedure to be aborted in the event of a non-stabilised approach situation after acquiring visual flight conditions and disconnecting the AP.- Long touch down and wet runway and tailwind conditions, with no possibility of stopping the plane in remaining runway distance.- The aircraft was correctly configured for uncontaminated runway operation.

All 44 passengers and six crew members were killed.Flight 363 departed from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport (DME) at 1820 local time on a scheduled service to Kazan (KZN). En route the crew noted that their navigation system's map was displaced. During the descent towards Kazan did not ask for vectors from air traffic control and continued their approach, which was flown 4 km to the north of the published approach procedure due to the map displacement issue.After turning to final for runway 29 the aircraft was not able to capture the localizer. The flight crew programmed a heading of 250° in the HDG SEL (Heading Select mode) of the autopilot and hurriedly configured the aircraft for landing. The approach was unstabilized and as the aircraft turned towards runway heading the copilot noticed the PAPI lights and saw they were too high. He initiated a go around. At that time the aircraft was at 270m (900 ft) and configured for landing with gear down, 30° flaps. The autopilot was in ALT HOLD mode with altitude programmed at 270 m.The use of the TO/GA switch caused the autopilot to be switched off. The flaps were raised to 15°, but no manual control inputs were made.  The increase in engine power and retracting the flaps caused a pitch-up of the airplane with the pitch angle reaching a value of about to 25°. Indicated airspeed began to decrease, the stabilizer automatically trimmed nose down. All the time the copilot was engaged in radio communications with the Kazan Tower controller. Subsequently the copilot reminded the captain to raise the undercarriage. With the pitch angle exceeding 25° the crew began using the control column to reduce the pitch angle. At this point, the aircraft was at an altitude of about 600 meters (2,000 feet), and continued to climb with a vertical speed of 20 m/s. Due to nose down input by the captain and trim system, the pitch angle decreased quickly. Vertical loads decreased to 0,5 g as the aircraft had reached the top of climbing at 2300 feet / 700 meters. Indicated airspeed had decreased to its minimum value of 117 knots. Vertical loads then decreased to about 0 g, with a negative pitch angle reaching 20°. The aircraft descended at a rate of more than 5000 ft/min (25 m/s). The EGPWS gave ""sink rate"" and ""pull up"" warnings as the aircraft pitch angle reached -60° with a load of -0.9 g.The aircraft collided with the ground at high speed, over 450 km/h, and a large negative pitch angle of about 75°. From the beginning of the missed approach until the collision with terrain, 45 seconds passed.The aircraft impacted the ground between the runway and the main taxiway about 1850 m past the runway 29 threshold.Investigation revealed that the captain received training to become a Boeing 737 captain after serving as a navigator between 1991 and 2010. The copilot used to be a flight engineer (1989 to 2008) and was also trained to become a Boeing 737 pilot. The captain had a very limited knowledge of English, which was considered insufficient to comprehend English language training documents and manuals. As the oversight of the training facility was poor, shortcomings in training were not noticed. Training and safety management within Tatarstan Airlines was considered equally poor.PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Russian)The cause of the crash Boeing 737-500 VQ-BBN were systemic deficiencies in the identification of hazards and risk control, as well as a non-functional safety management system in the airline and the lack of control over the level of training of the crew members from the aviation authorities at all levels (Tatar MTU BT, Federal Air Transport Agency), which led to the admission of an unprepared flight crew.When the missed approach was executed the crew did not recognize the fact that the autopilot was off and the aircraft pitched up to a complex spatial position (Nose up Upset). The PIC's (pilot flying) lack of flying skills in complex spatial positions (Upset Recovery) led to the creation of a large negative overload, loss of spatial orientation and transfer of the aircraft into a steep dive (pitch down to 75°) until the impact with the ground.The need for a go-around was caused by the position of the aircraft relative to the runway, which was the result of ""a map shift"" effect (Map shift, an error in the determination of the aircraft position by onboard systems) by about 4 km, the crew's inability in the circumstances to integrated piloting and maintenance of navigation with the required accuracy, and the lack of active assistance of the air traffic control service under the long-term monitoring of significant deviations from the approach procedure.17-11-201317-11-201317-11-201317-11-201317-11-201317-11-201317-11-201317-11-201317-11-201318 June 1990N35135Boeing13 July 1990F-GGMLEuralair International1 June 1992F-GGMLAir France15 July 19955X-USMUganda Airlines17 Feb. 2000PT-SSIRio Sul17 Dec. 2001PT-SSIRio Sul24 July 2005N785AWAWAS1 Sep. 2005YR-BABBlue Air17 May 2008LZ-BOYBulgaria Air18 Dec. 2008VQ-BBNTatarstan Air27 Nov. 2012VQ-BBNTatarstan Air",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2013

Unfortunately, the descending wind shear force, accompanied by the minimum airspeed the aircraft had at the time of descent, did not give it any chance of avoidance.The increase in power was insufficient to allow the aircraft to maintain its descent profile.The significant twisting of the propeller blades confirms that the aircraft was powered for a go-around.Contributing FactorThe absence of the windsock in the vicinity of the KAMAKO runway certainly contributed to this accident. Otherwise, the PIC could have confided in it to assess the strength and direction of the wind before initiating the descent.The presence of this equipment could have allowed the PIC to decide in due time to continue the descent or to go around.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,BPEA DR Congo ,2013

After the aircraft climbed straight ahead over the ocean to about 2,200 ft and 200 knots groundspeed, the copilot requested radar vectors back to the departure airport due to an ""engine failure."" The controller assigned an altitude and heading, and the copilot replied, ""not possible,"" and requested a 180-degree turn back to the airport, which the controller acknowledged and approved. However, the airplane continued a gradual left turn to the north as it slowed and descended. At 195234 the crew radioed ""Mayday, mayday, mayday"". The Miami Departure controller instructed the crew to turn left, heading 260 and continued to give vectors for an approach to runway 28R.During the next 3 minutes, the copilot requested, received, and acknowledged multiple instructions from the controller to turn left to the southwest to return to the airport. However, the airplane continued its slow left turn and descent to the north. The airplane slowed to 140 knots and descended to 900 ft as it flew northbound, parallel to the shoreline, and away from the airport. Eventually, the airplane tracked in the direction of the airport, but it continued to descend and impacted the ocean about 1 mile offshore, broke up and sank.According to conversations recorded on the airplane's cockpit voice recorder, no checklists were called for, offered, or used by either flight crewmember during normal operations (before or during engine start, taxi, and takeoff) or following the announced in-flight emergency. After the ""engine failure"" was declared to the air traffic controller, the pilot asked the copilot for unspecified ""help"" because he did not ""know what's going on,"" and he could not identify the emergency or direct the copilot in any way with regard to managing or responding to the emergency.

The flight departed Dakar at 0357 local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL320. At 0750 local time the MD-11 began a continuous descent towards São Paulo. The flight was eventually cleared down to 4500 feet and at 0803 the crew commenced working the approach checklist. The copilot then commented that they were a little high, at 6200 feet amsl. The pilot in command replied that they would be fine during the next procedural turn. Two minutes later the airplane turned onto the final approach course for runway 15. The copilot radioed that the flight was established on the ILS for runway 15. The crew then configured the airplane for landing. After contacting Campinas Tower, the flight received clearance to land with the wind at 140 degrees, 14 knots. At 0807, shortly after selecting flaps at 35 degrees, the pilot in command switched off the autopilot. Flaps were set at 50 degrees and the crew then worked the landing checklist. The approach was continued and the airplane touched down at 0808 at a speed of 152 kts Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) and a 7° pitch angle.

The aircraft was carrying a pilot and nine passengers. One of the passengers, in the right pilot seat, was a pilot about to begin training with the operator.Takeoff and climb from Kamusi were normal and the pilot levelled off at 9,000 ft above mean sea level and completed the appropriate checklist. Between Kamusi and Purari River the terrain is mostly flat and forest covered with areas of swampland and slow-moving tidal rivers. Habitation is very sparse with occasional small villages on the rivers. The weather was generally good in the area with a cloud base of 3,000 ft and good visibility between build-ups. Approximately two minutes into the cruise there was a loud 'pop' followed by a complete loss of engine power. After configuring the aircraft for best glide speed at 95 knots, the pilot turned the aircraft right towards the coast and rivers and completed the Phase 1 memory recall items for engine failure in flight. He was assisted by the passenger in the right pilot seat, who switched on the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) and began broadcasting 'mayday' on the area frequency. Checking the database in the Global Positioning System (GPS), the pilot found the airstrip at Kibeni on the eastern side of the Palbuna River. Kibeni airstrip is disused, uneven, and short but it was the only open ground in the area on which the pilot could attempt a forced landing. The pilot, assisted by the passenger next to him, tried unsuccessfully to restart the engine. The passenger continued to give position reports and to communicate with other aircraft. At about 3,000 ft AMSL the pilot asked for radio silence on the area frequency so he could concentrate on the approach to Kibeni airstrip, flying a left hand circuit to land in a south westerly direction. He selected full flaps during the final stages of the approach, which arrested the aircraft's rate of descent and caused it to float. The wheels contacted the ground three times but this did not slow the aircraft enough to enable the pilot to stop it before the end of the airstrip.In order to clear the trees between the airstrip and the river, the pilot elected to pull up on the control column. The aircraft became airborne again, damaging the crown of a coconut palm as it passed over the trees between the end of the airstrip and the river. The pilot turned hard left and pushed forward on the control column to avoid stalling the aircraft. He levelled the wings before the aircraft impacted the water. The aircraft came to rest inverted and partially submerged, and immediately filled with water. After a short delay while he gained his bearings under water, the pilot was able to undo his harness and open the left cockpit door. He swam to the surface, opened the door at the rear of the fuselage, and helped the surviving passengers to safety on the river bank. After approximately 20 minutes, villagers arrived in a canoe and transported the pilot and surviving passengers across the river.Pratt & Whitney Canada examined the engine and concluded that the engine power loss was caused by the fracture of one Compressor Turbine (CT) blade in fatigue, which resulted in secondary damage to the remainder of the CT blades and downstream components. The fatigue originated from multiple origins on the pressure side of the blade trailing edge. The root cause for the fatigue initiation could not be determined with certainty.The PNG AIC investigation report did not contain a Probable Cause statement as per ICAO Annex 13.25-11-201325-11-201325-11-2013",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2013

A postflight inspection revealed substantial damage to the aft pressure bulkhead assembly, as well as various frames, stringers and structural longerons. In addition, several attachments for the elevator flight control pulleys and flight control cable guides were damaged. The operator noted that the airplane's pressurization system had been removed years ago, when the airplane was converted to a cargo configuration. The operator reported that after loading the airplane, just before departure, the crew inspected the five nylon strapping mechanisms that secured the four drilling tools to the floor of the airplane. The crew reported that all five of the nylon straps were tight before departure, but gathered that one or more had loosened slightly during taxi and takeoff, allowing two of the tools to shift aft during takeoff. The crew also noted that the drilling tools were covered with ice and snow, which likely aided in the tools sliding along the aluminum, diamond plate-covered floor of the airplane.PROBABLE CAUSE ""A load shift during takeoff, which resulted in substantial damage to the aft bulkhead and associated structures.""25-11-2013",Cargo,NTSB ,2013

The airplane was destroyed and all 27 passengers and six crew members were killed.The flight departed Maputo at 1126 local time (0926 UTC) and was scheduled to land at Luanda at 1410 local time (1310 UTC). The airplane proceeded over Botswana at FL380 and was in contact with Gaborone ACC. At the EXEDU waypoint, about 1309 local time (1109 UTC), the aircraft commenced a sudden descent, which continued until the airplane impacted the ground at 111626 UTC.Minutes before the crash the co-pilot left the cockpit for the lavatory. The captain then manually changed the altitude preselector from 38,000 feet to an altitude of 4,288 feet. This was changed to 1,888 feet and then to 592 feet. The auto throttle was manually reengaged and throttle lever then automatically retarded and set to idle. The airspeed was manually selected several times until the end of the recording, which remained close to the Vmo (maximum operating limit speed). During the descent the captain used the speed brake handle to activate the spoilers. On the cockpit voice recorder sounds were heard of someone pounding on the cockpit door.It was discovered that the captain went through numerous life experiences ranging from uncompleted divorce process, the suspected suicide of his son on November 21, 2012 and a recent heart surgery of his youngest daughter.Probable CauseThe inputs to the auto flight systems by the person believed to be the Captain, who remained alone on the flight deck when the person believed to be the co-pilot requested to go to the lavatory, caused the aircraft to departure from cruise flight to a sustained controlled descent and subsequent collision with the terrain.Contributing factorsThe non-compliance to company procedures that resulted in a sole crew member occupying the flight compartment.29-11-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,DAAI Namibia ,2013

There were no injuries.During the weather briefing prior to departure, the captain and the first officer noted that there was a wintry pressure pattern, a trough accompanied by cold air would pass through western Japan during the morning, there was no specific information indicating the possibility of lightning on the flight planned route of the aircraft. The DHC-8-400Q turboprop aircraft departed Fukuoka Airport, Japan at 0903 hours local time on a flight to Fukue Airport. The captain was Pilot Flying.While the aircraft was cruising at an altitude of 12,000 ft, heading for Fukue Airport, the captain and the first officer visually observed white clouds with a top height of 11,000 ft, on its course. When the aircraft began to descend at around 0924 in order to approach the airport, the observed clouds were not so thick as could be suspected to cause turbulence or lightning but were displayed on the weather radar display of the aircraft in a green color, indicating an area with weak rainfall. At around 0930, while descending through the clouds at 5300 ft, the captain and the first officer observed a strong flash of light coming from the left fore side of the cockpit and heard a loud ""bang"" immediately after that.Afterwards, the captain and the first officer carried out checks to determine if there were any abnormalities. Although a wind noise was heard from the nose direction, no other abnormalities were identified.On the final approach to the airport, the aircraft exited the clouds, and landed at the airport at 0937. After landing, the captain, the first officer and the mechanic carried out inspections on the aircraft, and consequently, the following were revealed- Five dents occurred on the aft side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose,- Six rivet heads on the upper left access panel on the nose were burned, and- The aft latch of the upper right access panel on the nose, as well as the fore and aft latches of the upper left access panel on the nose were opened.The Company inspected the details of the damage of the aircraft, and confirmed that deformations had also occurred on the internal structure supporting the rear side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose.PROBABLE CAUSES ""In the accident, it is somewhat likely that the aircraft sustained damage on the aft side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose and on the portions of the internal structure supporting the outer skin because it was subjected to a powerful shockwave generated by the discharge of lightning while making a landing approach.""29-11-2013",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,JTSB ,2013

The weather was good with light and variable winds and no low cloud. The pilot flying, in the right seat, was completing line training, having recently converted to the A320 series. He had a total of 292 flying hours, of which 138 on the A320. The commander, an experienced Type Rating Examiner, was the pilot monitoring.The commander reported that the aircraft was on a stable approach, with full flap. The co-pilot smoothly commenced the flare at the correct height; however, at about 10 ft radio altitude he made an additional nose-up sidestick input. This resulted in an unusually high pitch attitude and, as the airspeed washed off, the aircraft started to sink. The co-pilot countered with an additional nose-up input as the main landing gear touched down. The ground spoilers automatically deployed and the pitch attitude continued to rise to a maximum of 12.3°, causing the tail to strike the runway. As the ground spoilers deployed the commander attempted to counter the increasing pitch with a large forward sidestick input. However, he did not press the take over button and the flight control software summed the inputs of the two sidesticks. As the co-pilot reduced his sidestick pitch input, the aircraft pitched down to 0° in three seconds. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and the right engine was shut down to allow a safe path for inspection of the aircraft by the RFFS. They identified paint damage and scratching of the aft fuselage and the commander decided not to start the APU. The aircraft was then positioned to its normal gate for passenger disembarkation, before being withdrawn from service for minor repairs. The lower fuselage skin, frames and butt splice between frames 67 and 72 were abraded by contact with the runway. At frame 70, deformation of the lower pressure bulkhead was noted 250 mm either side of the centreline and a 190 mm long crack was found on the lower ring frame assembly.The airplane was ferried back to Zurich unpressurised on December 12 at 9000 feet.

All five on board were killed.Immediately after takeoff the left engine failed, likely as a result of fuel exhaustion. The aircraft entered a steep descent and impacted trees in the Amazon forest.Contributing factors.- Organizational culture - a contributor.The utilization of an aircraft not included in the Operating Specifications and of a runway neither registered nor approved, with a pilot who did not have the amount of hours necessary nor specific training, disclose a culture based on informal practices, which led to operation below the minimum safety requirements.- Pilots forgetfulness - undetermined.It is possible that the pilot forgot to verify the quantity of fuel in the tanks of the aircraft before takeoff. - Training - undetermined.The lack of specific training for the pilot and for the coordinator who, possibly, assumed the function of instructor may have compromised their operational performance during the preparation and conduction of the flight, since they were not effectively prepared for the activity.- Flight indiscipline - undetermined.It is possible that the pilot failed to comply with the prescriptions of the legislation relatively to the minimum amount of fuel required for the flight leg.The operation of the aircraft by a pilot with expired qualifications and without the required training goes against the prescriptions at the time, but it was not determined whether this pilot (coordinator) was in the aircraft controls at the moment of the accident.The transport of a cylinder onboard the aircraft also configures flight indiscipline, since it goes against the legislation which prohibits the transport of such material.- Instruction - undetermined.The lack of training of the differences may have contributed to the forgetting to verify the fuel tanks, a procedure that is prescribed in the aircraft manual.Likewise, lack of training may have deprived the pilots from acquiring proficiency for the operation of the aircraft in a single engine condition.- Memory - undetermined.The fact of conducting a flight to provide assistance in an emergency situation may have contributed to the pilot having forgotten to check safety parameters, such as the amount of fuel necessary.- Motivation - undetermined.The pilots intention to earn his operational promotion may have stimulated him excessively, to the point of disregarding the minimum safety requirements for the operation. In addition, the emergency nature of the flight request possibly added to the motivation of the pilot and the coordinator.- Insufficient pilots experience - undetermined.It is possible that, due to having little total experience either both of flight and in the aircraft, the pilot lost control of the aircraft when faced with the situation of in-flight engine failure after the takeoff.- Decision-making process - undetermined.It is possible that the pilot and the coordinator prioritized the emergency requirement of the situation, failing to evaluate other aspects relevant for the safety of the flight, such as planning, for example.- Managerial oversight - a contributor.The lack of control on the part of the companys management in relation to the flights operating outside of the main base allowed the pilot and the base manager to conduct a flight without the operating sector authorization.The lack of supervision of the air transport service provision by the contracting organizations allowed the company to provide services without the minimum conditions required by the legislation.Such conditions exposed the passengers to the risks of an irregular operation.",Ambulance,CENIPA ,2013

Tambo International Airport, South Africa. The flight crew prepared for a departure from runway 03L and expected a taxi clearance for taxiway Alpha, which ran parallel to runway 03L. After pushback the flight was cleared by the Tower controller via a different route ""Speedbird 34, taxi Bravo to Cat 2 holding point, Runway 03L"". The flight crew did not re-brief for this new route and instead the copilot, who was Pilot Flying, began taxiing towards taxiway B. ""Straight down all the way isnt it? It is, yeah makes it nice and easy doesnt it? And Bravo will take us all the way to the threshold. Im following this line jinking slightly to the right and then straight ahead. Perfect"", the copilot stated.Taxiway Bravo ran parallel to taxiway Alpha. But at some point the taxiway curved left where it merged with Alpha. At that point a smaller taxiway Mike proceeded straight ahead to an apron.In night time conditions the pilots missed the curve to the left because the two green lead in centreline lights were inoperative. The taxiway information sign lighting was also inoperative. The flight continued onto Mike and the copilot noticed that the taxiway seemed smaller. The Tower controller noticed the crew's mistake on his ground radar and instructed the crew to stop ""Speedbird 34, hold your position"". At that time the right hand wing impacted a building to the right of the taxiway. The wing sliced through the second storey, injuring four workers inside.The aircraft was immobilized and passengers deplaned through the rear exit on the left hand side after a fuel leak was contained.PROBABLE CAUSE The loss of situational awareness caused the crew to taxi straight ahead on the wrong path, crossing the intersection/junction of Bravo and Mike instead of following Bravo where it turns off to the right and leads to the Category 2 holding point. Following aircraft stand taxilane Mike; they collided with a building on the righthand side of Mike.Contributory Factors The crew did not conduct a briefing to discuss the cleared route, nor did they refer to the correct taxiway information in chart 10-6. In combination with the ground movement visual aids, this created confusion and loss of situational awareness when taxiing on taxiway Bravo.22-12-201322-12-201322-12-2013",International Scheduled Passenger,CAA SouthAfrica ,2013

The co-pilot was the pilot flying at this time. The aircraft first contacted Hewanorra Tower at 1908 and reported 128 miles southwest of the airport. The tower controller advised the captain of the weather, as follows Wind variable between 180 and 300 degrees at 09 Knots, 5000 meters visibility with thunder storm activity at the field...clouds few at 600 feet, scattered at 1100 feet, Thunderstorms in all quadrants, temperature 25, dew point 24, QNH 1012.At 1924, the captain asked the tower controller to confirm that the airport was still open, the controller replied that the airport was closed due to weather and proceeded to give the weather conditions. This weather report included winds of between 20 and 40 Knots varying between 210 and 360 degrees. The visibility at the airport had decreased to 2000 meters and lightning was reported. The captain advised that he was now 18 miles South West of the airport and would like to enter the hold at position TUBED.At 1926, the controller advised that the Metrological Office reported that their will be no expected change in the weather for the next hour.At 1948, the captain requested from the controller if there was any change in the weather. He was advised that there was not and was further asked to confirm that he was holding at position TUBED. The captain advised that they were not at TUBED but were 10 miles South West of TUBED due to weather.At 1955, the controller advised that there was some improvement in the visibility at the airport and asked the crew of Flight VS98 to standby for the official Met report. The 2000 weather was given at 2003 as follows (Wind 020 degrees at 25 knots, visibility 3000 meters with thundershowers, clouds few at 600 feet, broken at 1200 feet CBs in all quadrants, broken at 1400 feet, temperature 24, dew point 22 and QNH 1013).After some discussion regarding the visibility required for landing, at 2005, the tower controller confirmed that the field was now open and the aircraft was cleared for the RNAV approach to runway 10 at Hewanorra.The captain was the pilot flying during the approach and landing.At 200455, St Lucia approach advised the crew to contact Martinique approach to coordinate the approach clearance as they had no contact with them. This was done and Martinique cleared the aircraft to 3000 feet and advised them to contact Hewanorra. Following confirmation of the clearance from Hewanorra approach, there was some discussion between the crew about the weather and the go around procedure to be used in the event of a missed approach. The fact that the wind was outside the cross wind limits of the aircraft was also mentioned.At 2008, Flight VS98 reported at position TUBED commencing the approach. Shortly before passing passion MATES, the co-pilot confirmed that the aircraft was fully configured for landing. He reported at the final fix at 1800 feet and confirms an altitude check.At 201259, Flight VS98 reported position MATES. The controller confirmed this and said that he does not have the aircraft in sight yet; however, at 201340 he confirmed having the aircraft in sight and cleared it to land giving the wind as 010 degrees at 10 knots. Fifteen seconds later, the crew reported the field in sight and confirmed the landing clearance.The aircraft landed at 201510. The crew reported that a ""juddering"" was felt and the aircraft deceleration was more significant than expected. It was also reported that the aircraft veered towards the left but was able to be brought under control. Shortly after this, the crew reported a number of ECAM cautions were displayed; they included air left wing leak.The aircraft taxied onto the ramp via taxiway C and parked on Stand 4. Both the taxiway and the stand were free from standing water at this time. The captain was then summoned by the ground engineer to come outside and look at the aircraft as the Pack Bay area had been damaged. The crew reported seeing no obstacles during the landing. However, on inspection, it was observed that the Pack Bay area on the underside of the aircraft had been extensively damaged.The investigation revealed that the original course of the river to the north of the runway had been diverted to allow for runway construction. The evidence indicates that as a result of the extreme weather and heavy rain that existed at the airport that night, the river burst its banks at the point where the original course of the river had been diverted 90 degrees to the west. This resulted in the touchdown area of the runway being flooded.After the aircraft had been positioned on stand # 4, prior to the disembarkation of the passengers, the river began flooding the airport terminal, the ramp and runway area.The Authoritys conclusion is that the aircraft landed in approximately one (1) to two (2) feet of water on the touchdown zone of Runway 10. This caused significant damage to the underside of the aircraft.",International Scheduled Passenger,,2013

The pilot and passenger were not injured.As the aircraft approached its cruising altitude of FL430, the indicated airspeed decreased to about 128 knots. The pilot then reduced the rate of climb to 500 ft/min. However, over the next 50 seconds, the speed gradually reduced by a further 10 kts.Close to FL430, the pilot checked his tablet to check the forecast. At that moment the aircraft pitched severely nose-down and rolled to the right, departing from controlled flight in a series of five 360° rolls to the right. The pilot briefly regained control before the aircraft stalled again and in the following recovery. The aircrafts wings were damaged in overload due to the +4.48g peak in acceleration, which was between the +3.6g ('limit' load) and +5.4g ('ultimate' load). The pilot returned to Leeds/Bradford at FL280 and made a successful landing.ConclusionThe pilot operated the aircraft in an autopilot mode which left it vulnerable to a stall and did not monitor the reducing airspeed as the aircraft reached its cruising altitude.

Both pilots indicated that takeoff through the initial descent was uneventful. The aircraft was configured for a flaps 30 landing. During the ILS approach to runway 25L, the captain used the Heads-up Guidance System (HGS) in the IMC mode. During the decent below 100 feet, the FO indicated that the runway environment was dark and sensed the runway was ""coming close fast"". He noted a slightly increased descent rate and before he could make a callout, the captain had begun to take corrective action. During the descent, the captain stated he was hand flying the airplane (autopilot and autothrottles were off) and used the localizer, glideslope and flare cues from the HGS. At approximately 30 feet, he transitioned from the HGS to the runway environment, noting it appeared ""pitch black."" He then noticed the runway edge lights and what appeared to be an increased sink rate.Both pilots indicated the airplane touched down firm, then bounced, and the second touch down was harder than the first. Neither were aware that they had struck the tail. The captain did not recall seeing a tail strike warning indication from the HGS.Post flight inspection revealed that the tail strike indicator was compressed and deep scrapes and wear damage to the lower aft fuselage skin. Further investigation revealed multiple fractured frames and buckled stringers, shear ties and straps.The airplane was ferried unpressurized from Las Vegas to Phoenix, AZ (PHX) on January 13 and continued the next day to Seattle-Paine Field, WA.

The flight crew notified the MED Air Traffic Control Tower of the discrepancy. The flight crew attempted to use the alternate procedure to lower the right main landing gear without success. The flight crew eventually landed the aircraft with the right main landing gear in the retracted position. The aircraft made a smooth touch down, slowing until the right engine nacelle contacted the runway. The aircraft remained under control during the landing with no injuries to the aircraft occupants.

The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries.The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 1004 and was bound for Aspen.The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 1210, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290º at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 1211, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 1221, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts.The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g.The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual.Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path.Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The flight crew's failure to maintain airplane control during landing following an unstabilized approach. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's decision to land with a tailwind above the airplane's operating limitations and their failure not to conduct a go-around when the approach became unstabilized.""05-01-201405-01-201405-01-201405-01-2014",Private,NTSB ,2014

Flight 890 was a domestic service from Imphal to Guwahati and Delhi in India.The aircraft landed at Guwahati at 1115 UTC and departed for Delhi at 1205 UTC with 12.7 tonnes of fuel on board. The filed alternates for the sector were Lucknow and Jaipur in that order. Overhead Lucknow, the crew received the Lucknow weather and when the aircraft was in range the Delhi ATIS weather was also copied.While in contact with Delhi ATC, the flight was advised to join the hold as the runway 28 RVR at Delhi had dropped to the lower end of CAT I operations. At this point runway 29 was below minima. AI890 was number twelve in sequence and continued to remain in the holding pattern for the next 20-25 minutes. During this period there was no attempt on the part of flight crew to seek Lucknow weather. Air India Flight dispatch also did not given any advice to the flight about Jaipur or Lucknow weather. The weather (visibility / RVR) reported on runway 29 was below CAT I conditions so runway was not available for this flight at that moment as the First Officer was only Cat I qualified. The aircraft flew 3 holds before intercepting the localizer runway 28 at 35 miles. RVR runway 28 also dropped below Cat. I minimas, therefore the crew discontinued approach and climbed to 8000 feet on runway heading before going on heading 180.Though the first planned diversion alternate was Lucknow, which had visibility of 2000 m (above minima), the captain elected to divert to Jaipur. Reason was that they were closer to Jaipur and they had inquired about the visibility from Dispatch for Jaipur, which was provided as 2000 m. At this stage the crew did not check complete weather of Jaipur. Minimum diversion fuel to Jaipur was 2.9 tonnes. AI890 commenced diversion to Jaipur with Fuel on Board of 3.1 tonnes. The aircraft came in contact with Jaipur for the first time when it was at 68 DME from Jaipur. At that time the crew came to know of the complete weather of Jaipur from the ATIS, which read visibility of 900 m, dew point 13°C, temperature 13°C, and RVR 1000m. At 60 miles and passing flight level 138, the crew informed Jaipur that the aircraft was descending for flight level 100 as cleared by Delhi control. The aircraft again informed Jaipur ATC its position at 55 miles, 50 miles and 42 miles from Jaipur which were also acknowledged by Jaipur ATC. During these contacts, weather of Jaipur was neither asked by the crew nor provided by ATC. When the aircraft was at flight level 83, the crew asked ATC Jaipur to confirm that they could carry out an ILS approach for runway 27 via the 10 DME arc. While confirming the requested approach, Jaipur ATC informed all the stations about the weather at that moment as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m. When the aircraft was at 30 miles from Jaipur, Jaipur ATC passed weather as visibility 400 m, RVR 1000 m and trend visibility becoming 350 m. At 28 DME from Jaipur, the aircraft was maintaining 6000 feet and on request was cleared by Jaipur ATC to descend to 5000 feet.When the aircraft was at 25 DME, from Jaipur, ATC advised that the weather was deteriorating rapidly and visibility was 400 meters. The crew however informed ATC that they were committed to land at Jaipur due to the aircraft fuel state. The fuel on board at that point of time was approx 2.6 tonnes and approach was commenced for Jaipur with a visibility of 500 m with trend reducing.The aircraft was no. 2 in approach at Jaipur and was cleared for the VOR/DME arc ILS approach runway 27 at 25 nm. Due to reducing visibility, Jaipur ATC asked all the aircraft inbound for Jaipur to come over head and join the JJP hold. The crew of AI890 asked for the weather which was provided as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m though RVR deteriorating to 550 m. The flight continued and flew the VOR/DME arc for an ILS runway 27 approach. ATC transmitted the RVR as 200 m and visibility as 50 m with trend reducing. Another scheduled flight ahead of AI890 carried out a missed approach and diverted to Ahmedabad. When the aircraft was above MDA (1480 feet AGL), ATC reported RVR 50 m and cleared the aircraft to land subject to minima. Both the flight crew maintained that they had seen the runway lights. The ILS approach was performed with dual auto pilot until 200ft Radio Altitude. After descending below MDA on auto pilot, the commander disconnected the auto pilot. The captain performed the final approach manually. The aircraft deviated to the left of the runway centre line and touched down on soft ground (in kutcha) on the left hand side of the runway. During touchdown and landing roll, the visibility was zero and crew were unable to see any of the reference cues. The crew had heard rumbling sound during landing roll. The commander stated that he did the manual landing as he was not sure if he could do an auto-land on a ground facility which is CAT I certified airfield in actual zero visibility.The aircraft continued to roll/ skid on the unpaved surface and during this period the left wing impacted trees causing damage to the left wing. Thereafter aircraft turned right and entered the runway finally coming to a halt on the left hand side of runway. There was no fire.The aircraft was disabled on the runway, forcing the following flight (a SpiceJet Boeing 737-800, flight SG256) to carry out a missed approach. That flight was already low on fuel after diverting from Delhi to Jaipur, just like AI890.The captain of SG256 then decided to return to Delhi irrespective of reported visibility and RVR. After diverting to Delhi, the aircraft came in contact with ATC Delhi, declared a MAYDAY due fuel with a request for straight and short vector for ILS 28. During the ILS approach for runway 28, the tower had reported RVR for runway 28 as 375m/900m/50m. A dual channel auto land was carried out.  Fuel remaining at that time was 400 kgs. Fuel remaining during engine shut down was 150 kgs.PROBABLE CAUSEThe cause below has been given considering events as a combination of organizational factors and human error.- The flight crew made an erroneous decision of diverting & continuing to an airfield with reducing visibility.- The flight crew attempted a manual landing in below minima conditions.- Lack of operational supervision and desired ground support to flight.- Internal quality assurance not capturing the hazards which slipped through due complacency- Lack of oversight of the flight operations.05-01-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2014

All four on board were killed.Before departure from Shoreham Airport, U.K, the pilot had called the destination airport, Trier-Föhren. He was told it would be better to postpone the departure because of thick fog. The departure was not postponed and the Citation jet took off from Shoreham about 1000 hours. Alternate airfields were Luxembourg and Frankfurt-Hahn. Given the weather conditions the owner of the aircraft expected a diversion, and according to family members did not but pressure on the pilots to land at Trier.The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 1145, while descending from FL90 to 5000 feet, the pilot in command contacted air traffic control to cancel their IFR clearance. The controller confirmed this and reported that they were 15 miles northwest of their destination airfield.The airplane was approaching runway 22 and descended until it was flying at a very low altitude, clearing trees by some 15-20 meters, according to eyewitnesses. It pulled up and struck an electricity pylon at a height of about 8 m above the ground. Control was lost and the airplane rolled inverted and crashed. It came to rest inverted on the site of a landfill, located 3,8 km from the threshold of runway 22 and about 700 m to the left of the extended centreline. A fire erupted.The continued descent to the ground likely occurred due to an erroneous selection of the target altitude with 0 ft (sea level) instead of the real aerodrome elevation (666 ft AMSL). Good Crew Resource Management could have brought this error to light but the different personality traits of the two pilots and particularly the captains low appreciation of the co-pilot probably negativelyinfluenced the working relationship in regards to CRM principles. Weather at Trier about the time of the accident was a visibility of 100-150 m in fog, wind 040° at 3-5 knots, temperature -1°C, QNH 1020 hPa.CausesThe accident was due to the following- The Pilot in Command (PIC) decided to conduct the VFR approach even though he was aware of the prevailing instrument weather conditions at the airport- It is likely that a wrong vertical profile was flown due to an erroneous selection on the navigation system - Due to an insufficient situational awareness of the pilots the descent was not aborted in time.The following factors contributed to the accident- Insufficient Crew Resource Management (CRM)12-01-201412-01-201412-01-2014",Unknown,BFU Germany ,2014

After takeoff from runway 11 at Roskilde, the aircraft was established in climb with a nose-up pitch attitude of approximately 13-15°. Just before reaching the flap retraction altitude of 400 feet above ground level, the flight crew noticed ""something white"" in front of the aircraft.The commander, who was the pilot flying, immediately initiated an aircraft pitch increase, but almost simultaneously a ""bang"" was heard and a bump was felt in the aircraft, most likely coming from the underside of the aircraft. The flight crew observed large white birds below the aircraft.The flight crew realized that the aircraft had been hit by one or more birds, probably Mute Swans, and decided to leave the flaps at the takeoff setting of 15°.Cockpit indications did not show any abnormalities and the aircraft handling and controllability did feel normal by the flight crew.In order to return to Roskilde, the flight crew performed a visual traffic pattern and approach to runway 11, followed by a normal landing and roll-out.The aircraft taxied to the run-up area for runway 29, where an inspection performed by the fire and rescue service personnel revealed that fuel leaked from the left wing.CONCLUSIONSThe accident was caused by a multiple birdstrike. Up to four Mute Swans damaged the left wing leading edge and the nose radome which resulted in bending of the skin and the stringer structure beneath. The left wing integral fuel tank structure was damaged resulting in a fuel leak.  Three contributing factors were identified 1. The lighting condition in combination with the colour of the birds. 2. The small relative movement between the birds and the aircraft. 3.

There were no personal injuries on the 3 crew and 16 passengers on board.Flight F7-250 had departed Leipzig Airport (LEJ), Germany on a scheduled service to Paris-CDG. The copilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM).The flight was cleared to perform an ILS approach to runway 27R. The aircraft intercepted the glide slope at 0725. The tower controller then cleared the flight to land and reported wind from 200° at 12 kt. The captain again advises the OPL by reminding him when to set up the aircraft for landing.At an altitude of 2,300 ft the landing configuration was set (20° flap) and the approach target speed of 123 kt was selected.  At a height of 1000 ft, the approach was stable and the runway was in sight. At a height of about 400 ft, the PF disconnected the autopilot and at 200 ft, the decision height, the crew decided to continue the approach.Passing 50 ft, the PF gradually returned the power levers to the ""flight idle"" position and initiated the flare. Shortly before touchdown the captain pulled on the control column to the maximum nose-up value (11°) and the attitude reached a value of 5°. The wheels of the main landing gear hit the ground hard, and the airplane was at an indicated speed of about 120 kt. The airplane then bounced. The copilot then pushed the control column forward, causing a nose down attitude. De PM then again pulled on the controls and the aircraft bounced a second time.The PM increased power which was immediately reduced by the PF. The nose landing gear of the aircraft then impacted the runway and collapsed.Conclusion (translated from French)During the flare, the PIC said that the landing was going to be hard. In the emergency, he acted quickly  by pulling on the controls without announcing his intentions to Copilot. This lack of coordination within the crew led to a double piloting and successive and opposite actions on the flight controls during the management of the bounced landing.28-01-2014",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2014

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries.On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet.The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15°. The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots. On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots. Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation. The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch. The cabin crew member and a passenger had difficulties opening a partly jammed main entrance door. In cooperation with the commander from the outside of the aircraft, they succeeded. From the outside of the aircraft, the commander opened the forward right hand cabin emergency exit door. The passengers and the cabin crew member evacuated the passenger cabin trough the main entrance door. The overall evacuation took approximately 30-40 seconds.Ilulissat Airport has a single, 07/25 asphalt runway, 845 m (2772 ft) long. Runway 07 has a 0,8% downslope for the first 550 m, followed by a 0,2% upslope for 295 m.ConclusionAdverse crosswind conditions at BGJN led to flight crew target fixation, a flight crew divergence from the operators stabilized approach parameters and a mental blocking of an appropriate decision on going around. The flight crew divergence from the operators stabilized approach parameters induced a non-stabilized approach, which in combination with power levers retarded below flight idle in flight resulted in an accelerated rate of descent leading to a hard landing, with side load on the left main landing gear at touchdown. The left main landing gear structural fuse pin sheared as a result of lateral and vertical overload stress.Cycling the power levers between ground and flight range prevented an appropriate deceleration of the aircraft and prolonged the landing roll. The prolonged landing roll combined with the application of full left rudder and no decisive use of reverse thrust on the side with the unaffected main landing gear made it impossible for the flight crew to maintain directional control. The lack of directional control resulted in the aircraft running off the side of the runway and the safety zone, respectively.29-01-201429-01-201429-01-201429-01-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,HCLJ Denmark ,2014

The airport's single runway, 01/19 (3000 m long, 45 m wide), was cleared of snow on the north side. The south side, from the threshold to the middle of the runway, was partly cleared with path of 21 m wide.On both sides of the path a 50-95 cm high snow berm was present.During final approach to runway 01 the pilot in command disconnected the autopilot and switched to manual control of the airplane.The plane landed on runway 01 at a distance of 230 m from the runway threshold, at a speed of 255 km/h. The wheels of the right hand main gear crossed the border the runway at a distance of about 520 m from the threshold and the aircraft continued along the side of the runway. The wheels left main landing gear remained on the runway. At a distance of 710 m from the threshold both engines quit due to ingress of large amounts of snow. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid until it stopped 1190 m from the beginning of the runway. There was no fire and none of the occupants were injured.CONCLUSION (translation from Russian)The cause of the accident with the aircraft A320-231 EY-623 was the aircraft collision with a snow berm while landing on an unprepared runway, which was cleared by a width of about 22m (runway width being 45m), and where there were snow berms at a height of 50-95cm along the borders. The aircraft's right main gear contacted a snow berm, which led to the destruction of the nose landing gear and self-termination of engines and the aircraft moving off the runway to the right.The accident was the result of a combination of the following factors- decision by the flight director to receive an aircraft on an unprepared runway;- the unreadiness of the runway at the time of arrival of the aircraft and the failure to make a corresponding entry in the ""Journal of the state of the airfield"" with the runway measures.02-02-201402-02-201402-02-201402-02-2014",International Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2014

All 18 on board sustained fatal injuries.Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 1243. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right. The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts.The cockpit voice recorder showed that the copilot had warned the captain not to descend or turn.The wreckage was located the following morning at an altitude of 7190 feet (2192 m). There were no surivors.CausesAfter detail investigation and thorough analysis of the circumstances and evidences, the Commission has determined that the most probable causes of the accident is the ""Losing situational awareness on the part of PIC while flying into instrument meteorological weather condition to the extent of Collision with terrain.""The contributing factors to the occurrence are;- Deteriorated weather associated with western disturbance, unstable in nature and embedded CB.- Inappropriate and insufficient crew coordination while changing course of action.16-02-201416-02-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIC Nepal ,2014

The captain was Pilot Flying (PF). The en route part and descent towards Funchal (FNC), Madeira, were uneventful.There was a partially cloudy sky at Funchal with good visibility, surface wind was strong from 330° at 14 kts gusting to 24 kts, with variations in direction between 220° and 020°. Temperature was 15°C. The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 05 seemed normal until the point Rosario, when he began to notice effects of ""wind shear"" and coincident with the automatic altitude call of 50 feet, the aircraft developed a high sink rate. The PF continued with the approach and he attempted to arrest the rate of descent but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced to a height of about 8 feet and continued for about 300 meters.During the second contact with the runway, the tail of the aircraft struck its surface at a speed of about 140 kts. The PF was able to control the aircraft safely within the confines of the runway.A preliminary visual inspection showed some deformation of the outer surface of the fuselage and significant skid marks on the underside of the rear fuselage.Closer inspection, performed by maintenance services, revealed the existence of a deformed drain tube, some bent struts with five cracks found on two fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads sustained in the contact with the runway.CAUSE The accident was due to an excessive nose up input after the first contact with the runway and at a time in which the aircraft was airborne at around 8 feet (RA) which, associated to the manual deployment of the speedbrakes and consequent loss of lift, resulted in a sharp nose up attitude (9.15°) to a point of causing the tail strike with the runway surface.Contributing factors1.

20-FEB-2014,ATR 72-212A (ATR 72-600),VH-FVR,Virgin Australia Regional,0.0,"near Sydney, NSW",https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20140220-0,En route (ENR),Substantial,Normal landing,"A Virgin Australia Regional ATR 72-600 sustained damage in an in-flight pitch disconnect event near Sydney, Australia.= Feb 20 accident =Flight VA657 departed Canberra, Australia at 1612 local time with the first officer as the pilot flying. A steeper-than-usual climb was carried out to reduce exposure to turbulence. However, other than the expected turbulence during the first 1,500 ft, there was nothing significant during the climb to FL170.During cruise, the crew conducted a routine brief for the anticipated arrival to runway 16R, which was expected to be standard except for commencement of descent 5 NM (9 km) earlier than normal to compensate for a tailwind. The captain noted the need to be cognizant of managing airspeed during the descent as the anticipated decreasing tailwind would result in a temporary increase in the indicated airspeed.The first officer commenced descent into Sydney with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode and a target airspeed of 235 kt (15 kt less than the maximum operating speed of 250 kt). The descent was reported to have been initially stable and smooth.On first contact with Sydney Approach the crew were assigned runway 16L. This was different to the expected runway and required the crew to re-brief the approach and change the instrument approach diagrams and navigational aid frequencies.Passing 8,500 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), the crew noticed a rapid airspeed increase. The first officer reported that the airspeed trend indicator was 'off the chart', indicating a very rapid increase in airspeed. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the aircraft's nose to control the speed. The first officer expected that, in combination, the pitch correction and power reduction would be sufficient to arrest the speed trend.The first officer reported that the aircraft felt 'heavy', as was normal for this aircraft at that speed, requiring two hands on the controls to move from the then -4° pitch angle. The captain reported being unsure if the first officer's control inputs would be sufficient to avoid exceeding the maximum operating speed limitation, so put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further.Shortly after, with both flight crew making simultaneous nose up pitch inputs on the controls, the aircraft rapidly pitched up with an associated increase in the g load. The first officer responded by immediately reversing the control input to nose down. Both flight crew noticed that the controls suddenly felt different and 'spongy'. At about the same time, aural and visual cockpit warnings activated. The crew verified that the aircraft was under control at a stable attitude and speed, observing that it was level or in a slight descent at an airspeed of about 230 kt.One of the cockpit warnings was 'pitch disconnect', indicating that the left and right elevator control systems had uncoupled from each other. This allowed for independent movement of the left and right elevators via the captain's and first officer's control columns respectively.The crew consulted the pitch disconnect checklist and worked to identify which control column was free and working normally. After determining that both controls were free, it was decided that the captain would be pilot flying for the remainder of the approach and landing at Sydney Airport. The aerodynamic loads generated during the pitch disconnect resulted in serious injury to the senior cabin crew member and significant damage to the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser. = Inspection =Two maintenance engineers were tasked to inspect the aircraft after landing. A readout of the aircraft systems computer revealed a maximum vertical load factor of 3.34 g at 1641 hours. This load factor was abnormally high and prompted one of the engineers to discuss it with the crew, who were surprised about the high value. The crew added associated with moderate turbulence to the maintenance log entry. Since this g-value was outside of the acceptable limits for the aircraft weight, the engineer he grounded the aircraft.  The applicable maintenance was determined to be the 'Inspection after flight in turbulence and/or exceeding VMO'.That evening a visual inspection was conducted of the wing, using an elevated platform. The engineer also used a torch to inspect the rear fuselage and tail. However, no high-access platform was available, so no close visual inspection was performed on the horizontal stabilizer. Other maintenance was carried out the next morning, which consisted of among others an operational test of the pitch uncoupling mechanism re-engagement system. The aircraft was then released for service on 1330 the day after the accident.Subsequent to the post-occurrence maintenance completed on 21 February 2014, the aircraft was operated on a further 13 flights. The respective flight crews did not record any anomalies or defects during their pre-flight inspections and there were no reports of any abnormal aircraft handling characteristics.= Feb 25 incident =On 25 February, aircraft VH-FVR was operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Albury, NSW. On descent into Albury, the aircraft passed in close proximity to birds, which alerted the captain to the possibility of a birdstrike on the left side of the aircraft. There were no in-flight indications that a bird had struck the aircraft but after landing, the captain noticed the aircrafts pitch trim system fluctuated abnormally.The captain conducted a walk-around inspection and, although there was no evidence of a birdstrike on the left of the aircraft, he identified a dent in the top leading edge of the vertical stabiliser. The captain advised the operators maintenance watch who dispatched an engineer to Albury to inspect the aircraft.The engineer used scissor lift equipment to gain access to, and inspect the stabiliser. He did not find any evidence of a birdstrike, such as blood or feathers. However, the engineer did find indications of significant structural damage to the horizontal stabiliser, and contacted maintenance watch to cancel the following flights. Upon further examination and discussion with the airline, it became evident that the damage found at Albury was probably a consequence of the occurrence on 20 February.FindingsFrom the evidence available, the following findings are made regarding the in-flight upset and inadvertent pitch disconnect involving ATR 72 aircraft, VH-FVR on 20 February 2014 resulting in cabin crew injury and serious aircraft damage. A post-event maintenance inspection was carried out but the aircraft damage was not detected. Consequently, the aircraft was operated for another 13 flights over 5 days before the damage was identified.Contributing factors- During the descent, when the sterile flight deck policy was applicable, the flight crew engaged in non-pertinent conversation. This distracted the crew and probably reduced their ability to monitor and respond to fluctuations of airspeed.- While passing through about 8,500 ft on descent into Sydney, the aircraft encountered a significant windshear that resulted in a rapidly decreasing tailwind. This led to a rapid increase in the airspeed, with the airspeed trend vector likely indicating well above the maximum operating speed (VMO).- Although the first officer (pilot flying) was in the process of attempting to control the airspeed, in response to the unexpectedly high airspeed trend indication, and their proximity to VMO, the captain (pilot not flying) perceived a need to immediately intervene, and made pitch control inputs before following the normal take-over procedure and alerting the first officer.- The addition of the captains and first officers nose-up control inputs resulted in a pitching manoeuvre that exceeded the limit load factor for the aircraft of 2.5 g.- The magnitude of the captain's nose-up control input was probably greater than he intended, due to his response to a high stress level, but increased the probability that the aircraft's limit load factor would be exceeded.- Shortly after the captain initiated the nose-up control inputs, the first officer reversed his control input. The differential forces in the left (captain) and right (first officer) pitch control systems were sufficiently large to inadvertently activate the pitch uncoupling mechanism, disconnecting the left and right pitch control systems.- Given the high airspeed, the asymmetric elevator deflections that occurred immediately following the pitch disconnect event resulted in aerodynamic loads on the tailplane that exceeded its strength and damaged the horizontal stabiliser.- The design of the ATR 72 pitch control system resulted in limited tactile feedback between the left and right control columns, reducing the ability of one pilot to detect that the other pilot is making control inputs. In addition, there were no visual or auditory systems to indicate dual control inputs. (Safety issue)20-02-201420-02-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ATSB ,2014

The captain was Pilot Flying. The en route part of the first leg was uneventful. Runway in use at Terceira-Lajes Airport was runway 15. There was a partially cloudy sky, good visibility, a strong surface wind from southwest (190° at 22 kts gusting to 32 kts), with direction variations between 160° and 230° and the air temperature was 15°C. The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 15 seemed normal until 5 NM from touchdown. Winds were registered at a speed of up to 50 kts and there was severe turbulence along the entire approach. Below 1000 feet the crew noticed effects of down-drafts and up-drafts, with huge variations in intensity until short final. The captain stated that he opted to maintain an angle of descent (G/S) above the recommended, due to severe turbulence and to ensure a safety margin. The entire approach was flown with Auto Thrust connected, for effective and accurate speed control. The aircraft developed a high sink rate and lost speed instantly. This was counteracted by the captain with increasing power and attitude, in an attempt to stabilize the sink-rate.Touchdown occurred with a high rate of descent and a short flare, resulting in an impact on the main landing gear of 3.52 G vertical acceleration, followed by a bounce.A forward push of the control column by the pilot flying resulted in a pitch-down attitude of -1.9° with a second impact of 2.75 G vertical acceleration over the nose wheel causing substantial damage in that area of the aircraft fuselage.An inspection revealed the existence of some folded braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay with some bent struts, cracks found in fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads applied in the contact with the runway.CAUSES 1. ProceduralThe flight crew did not comply with aircraft manufacturer procedures and company SOPs, which required a ""go around"" manoeuvre;2. ActuationThe accident was due to an excessive control column forward input, causing aircraft negative pitch attitude which led to a very high impact loading on the nose undercarriage, leading to the severe damage of braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay, struts and fuselage frames. This followed a chain of events, which contributed to the accident including the wind gusts, turbulence, decision to fly above ILS G/P, the use of the A/T without A/P and the decision to land from an unstabilized final approach.The following were considered as contributing factors1. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulent conditions;2. The PF established an approach profile of one dot of scale above the nominal ILS G/S;3. The PF did not disconnect the A/T after disengagement of the A/P;4. Deviation from aircraft ""stabilized approach"" profile;5.

There were 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.The Boeing 777-2H6ER took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport's runway 32R at 0041. At 0042 the flight was cleared to climb to FL180 and was issued a direct track by Lumpur Approach to the IGARI waypoint. MH370 was then transferred to Lumpur Radar and was cleared to climb to FL250. At 0050 the flight was further cleared to the planned cruising altitude of FL350. MH370 reported maintaining FL350 at 0107. Last radio contact was at 0119 when the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller instructed the flight to contact the radio frequency of Ho Chi Minh Air Traffic Control Centre, Vietnam ""Malaysian Three Seven Zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120 decimal 9 Good Night"". One of the flight crew members replied ""Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero."" At 0121 MH370 was observed on the radar screen of the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller as it passed over waypoint IGARI. Nine seconds later the radar label for MH370 disappeared from the radar screen. The transponder was switched off. At 0138 Ho Chi Minh ATCC contacted Kuala Lumpur ATCC on the whereabouts of MH370. Kuala Lumpur ATCC contacted the airline's operations centre, Singapore ACC, Hong Kong ACC, and Phnom Penh ACC, failing to establish the location of MH370.Meanwhile, the airplane flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest. Primary radar data showed that the aircraft tracked along the Malacca Strait. During this time the aircraft passed close to waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM and possibly IGOGU along a section of airway N571. The final primary radar fix occurred at 0222.From then on seven handshakes between the aircraft's SATCOM system and the Inmarsat ground station were recorded. Last satellite data was recorded at 0811 Malaysian time.Initially search efforts focused on the South China Sea area. On 24 March 2014 further analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data indicated that MH370 flew south and ended its flight in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. A surface search was conducted of probable impact areas along an arc, identified by calculations based on Inmarsat data. The search was carried out from 18 March - 28 April 2014. This search effort was undertaken by an international fleet of aircraft and ships with the search areas over this time progressing generally from an initial southwest location along the arc in a north-easterly direction. No debris associated with MH370 was identified either from the surface search, acoustic search or from the ocean floor search in the vicinity of acoustic detections, which were initially believed to have been from the pingers on the flight recorders. The ocean floor search was completed on 28 May 2014.On June 26 the ATSB published a new search area based on refinements to the analysis of both the flight and satellite data. The priority area of approximately 60,000 km2 extends along the arc for 650 km in a northeast direction from Broken Ridge, an underwater ridge. The width of the priority search area is 93 km.On July 29, 2015 a flapperon washed ashore on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean.

As the captain taxied onto runway 27L for departure, he noticed that the wrong runway was entered in the FMC. The captain asked the first officer to correct the runway entry in the FMC, which she completed about 27 seconds before the beginning of the takeoff roll; however, she did not enter the FLEX temperature (a reduced takeoff thrust setting) for the newly entered runway or upload the related V-speeds. As a result, the FMC's ability to execute a FLEX power takeoff was invalidated, and V-speeds did not appear on the primary flight display (PFD) or the multipurpose control display unit during the takeoff roll. Once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, the captain set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called ""engine thrust levers not set."" According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an ""engine thrust levers not set"" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent.However, the captain responded by saying ""they're set"" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required. As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected. The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert. The airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. The captain had ""the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly"" and that he decided ""the safest action was not to continue,"" so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L.The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the ""thrust not set"" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert. At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The captain's decision to reject the takeoff after the airplane had rotated. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to follow standard operating procedures by not verifying that the airplane's flight management computer was properly configured for takeoff and the captain's failure to perform the correct action in response to the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring alert.""13-03-201413-03-201413-03-201413-03-201413-03-201413-03-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2014

The 2 pilots were not injured. The flight originated at Opa-locka, Florida (OPF), about 0952.The two flight crewmembers reported that, after landing on runway 36, the pilot, who was the pilot flying, applied the brakes normally; however, the airplane did not decelerate as expected. The pilot applied the brakes a second time, and the right main landing gear tire subsequently failed. The airplane departed the end of runway 36 and came to rest in an area of unfinished gravel, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004.The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking.The pilots' inadequate in-flight planning and improper selection of runway 36 for landing, which resulted in a significant quartering tailwind during the landing, exceedance of the airplane's braking capability, and a subsequent runway overrun.",Private,NTSB ,2014

The baggage on board was approx. 50 lbs. There was 2100 lbs. of fuel on board. After boarding of the passengers, the aircraft engines were started at 1130 hrs. The aircraft taxied out via taxiway D. After ATC departure clearance the aircraft was lined up for take-off. On clearance from ATC the take off roll was initiated and all the parameters were found normal. The rotation was initiated at 98 knots and the aircraft climbed to 10-15 feet AGL. The commander has stated that after lift-off, immediately the left rudder got locked in the forward position resulting in the aircraft yawing and rolling to left.

The apron management services agent asked the flight to be pushed back facing east.The crew of the airplane parked at J11 then also requested pushback. In order to allow this airplane to start its manoeuvre sooner, the apron management services agent then asked the crew of F-HBLF to be towed, with the assistance of a tug, after its pushback, facing south until abeam stand 12 at the end of their pushback. During the pushback, the crew of F-HBLF started the airplane's two engines, which stabilised at ground idle. Following the pushback from J10, the airplane was on the axis specified in the documentation.In order to position the airplane on the centreline of taxiway E7, the tug driver had to make the airplane make a turn of about 90° with a short turn radius. To do this, he positioned his tug at approximately 90° to the airplane axis. When the tug began to pull the aircraft, the safety cotter pins on the tow bar coupling head broke. The coupling head was then only connected to the tow bar by an axle around which it could pivot horizontally.Under the effect of its inertia and the thrust of the two engines at idle, the aircraft continued to advance in a straight line. When the coupling head reached the stop, the airplane pivoted towards the right and collided with the tug.This specific pushback and towing procedure was prohibited for stand J10 following two similar previous occurrences.LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONThe apron management services agent asked that the pushback be followed by a pull forward with the assistance of the tug, despite the ban in the apron management services operations manual on carrying out this manoeuvre on departure from stand J10.The common use of this manoeuvre at the other stands and the absence of any explanation of the reasons for the ban at that specific stand likely led the apron management services agent to request a non-standard procedure.The tug driver did not question the request from the apron management services agent and repeated by the crew of F-HBLF. The operating instructions in fact specify that the latter are ""according to the instructions from ATC and validation by the aircraft captain"".In order to be able to pull the aeroplane, the driver had to set an excessive angle between the tow bar and the aeroplanes axis. The link between the tug and the aeroplane then broke. The aeroplanes inertia following its being moved and the thrust from its engines at idle made the aeroplane move forward, which led to the collision with the tug.Following this event, the apron management services operations manual was modified to make clear the reasons for the ban.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2014

The aircraft was scheduled to operate three commercial air transport (cargo) sectors from Athens to Bergamo, then to Paris Charles de Gaulle, and finally East Midlands.The co-pilot completed the pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft in good light, and found nothing amiss. The departure from Athens was uneventful, but a combination of factors affecting Bergamo (including poor weather, absence of precision approach aids, and work in progress affecting the available landing distance) led the crew to decide to route directly to Paris, where a normal landing was carried out.The aircraft departed Paris for East Midlands at 0040 hrs UTC, loaded with 10 tonnes of freight, 8 tonnes of fuel (the minimum required was 5.6 tonnes), and with the co-pilot as Pilot Flying.Once established in the cruise, the flight crew obtained the latest ATIS information from East Midlands, which stated that runway 27 was in use, although there was a slight tailwind, and Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) were in force. They planned to exchange control at about FL100 in the descent, for the commander to carry out a Category III autoland. However, as they neared their destination, the weather improved, LVPs were cancelled, and the flight crew re-briefed for an autopilot approach, followed by a manual landing, to be carried out by the co-pilot. The landing was to be with Flap 30, Autobrake 2, and idle reverse thrust.The final ATIS transmission which the flight crew noted before landing stated that the wind was 130/05 kt, visibility was 3,000 metres in mist, and the cloud was broken at 600 ft aal.The captain established radio contact with the tower controller, and the aircraft was cleared to land; the surface wind was transmitted as 090/05 kt. The touchdown was unremarkable, and the autobrake functioned normally, while the co-pilot applied idle reverse thrust on the engines.As the aircrafts speed reduced through approximately 60 kt, the co-pilot handed control to the commander, who then made a brake pedal application to disengage the autobrake system. However, the system remained engaged, so he made a second, more positive, brake application. The aircraft ""shuddered"" and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the left main landing gear detached. The captain used the steering tiller to try to keep the aircraft tracking straight along the runway centreline, but it came to a halt slightly off the centreline, resting on its right main landing gear, the remains of the left main landing gear leg, and the left engine lower cowl. The two crew members were uninjured and there was no fire.ConclusionsThe damage to the flap system, fuselage, and MLG equipment was attributable to the detachment of the left MLG axle, wheel and brake assembly. The damage to the MLG outer cylinder, engine and nacelle was as result of the aircraft settling and sliding along the runway.The left MLG axle assembly detached from the inner cylinder due to the momentary increase in bending load during the transition from auto to manual braking. The failure was as a result of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue weakening the high strength steel substrate at a point approximately 75 mm above the axle.It is likely that some degree of heat damage was sustained by the inner cylinder during the overhaul process, as indicated by the presence of chicken wire cracking within the chrome plating over the majority of its surface. However, this was not severe enough to have damaged the steel substrate and therefore may have been coincidental. Although the risk of heat damage occurring during complex landing gear plating and refinishing processes is well understood and therefore mitigated by the manufacturers and overhaul agencies, damage during the most recent refinishing process cannot be discounted.The origin of the failure was an area of intense, but very localised heating, which damaged the chrome protection and changed the metallurgy; ie the formation of martensite within the steel substrate. This resulted in a surface corrosion pit, which, along with the metallurgical change, led to stress corrosion cracking, fatigue propagation and the eventual failure of the inner cylinder under normal loading.29-04-201429-04-2014",Cargo,AAIB ,2014

All four passengers and three crew members were killed in the accident.During the engine start process, the flight crew neglected to disengage the airplane's gust lock system, which locks the elevator, ailerons, and rudder while the airplane is parked to protect them against wind gust loads. Further, before initiating takeoff, the pilots neglected to perform a flight control check that would have alerted them of the locked flight controls. A review of data from the airplanes quick access recorder revealed that the pilots had neglected to perform complete flight control checks before 98% of their previous 175 takeoffs in the airplane, indicating that this oversight was habitual and not an anomaly.A mechanical interlock between the gust lock handle and the throttle levers restricts the movement of the throttle levers when the gust lock handle is in the ON position. According to Gulfstream, the interlock mechanism was intended to limit throttle lever movement to a throttle lever angle (TLA) of no greater than 6° during operation with the gust lock on. However, postaccident testing on nine in-service G-IV airplanes found that, with the gust lock handle in the ON position, the forward throttle lever movement that could be achieved on the G-IV was 3 to 4 times greater than the intended TLA of 6°.During takeoff from runway 11 at Bedford-Hanscom Field, which is 2137 m (7011 feet) long, the pilot-in-command (PIC) manually advanced the throttle levers, but the engine pressure ratio (EPR) did not reach the expected level due to the throttles contacting the gust lock/throttle lever interlock. The PIC did not immediately reject the takeoff; instead, he engaged the autothrottle, and the throttle levers moved slightly forward, which allowed the engines to attain an EPR value that approached (but never reached) the target setting. As the takeoff roll continued, the second-in-command made the standard takeoff speed callouts as the airplane successively reached 80 knots, the takeoff safety speed, and the rotation speed. When the PIC attempted to rotate the airplane, he discovered that he could not move the control yoke and began calling out ""(steer) lock is on."" At this point, the PIC clearly understood that the controls were locked but still did not immediately initiate a rejected takeoff. If the flight crew had initiated a rejected takeoff at the time of the PICs first ""lock is on"" comment or at any time up until about 11 seconds after this comment, the airplane could have been stopped on the paved surface. However, the flight crew delayed applying brakes for about 10 seconds and further delayed reducing power by 4 seconds; therefore, the rejected takeoff was not initiated until the accident was unavoidable.The airplane thus failed to stop on the runway and continued onto the runway safety area and then the grass. The airplane continued on the grass, where it struck approach lighting and a localizer antenna assembly, before coming to rest in a gully, on about runway heading, about 1,850 feet from the end of the runway. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the airplane aft of the cockpit; however; all major portions of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The nose gear and left main landing gear separated during the accident sequence and were located on the grass area between the safety area and the gully.Probable Cause ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crewmembers failure to perform the flight control check before takeoff, their attempt to take off with the gust lock system engaged, and their delayed execution of a rejected takeoff after they became aware that the controls were locked. Contributing to the accident were the flight crewshabitual noncompliance with checklists, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporations failure to ensure that the G-IV gust lock/throttle lever interlock system would prevent an attempted takeoff with the gust lock engaged, and the Federal Aviation Administrations failure to detect this inadequacy during the G-IVs certification.""31-05-201431-05-201431-05-201431-05-201431-05-2014",Private,NTSB ,2014

At 0430 LT, they reported to the Juanda Tower controller that the runway was clear from any hazard except the area near intersection N3 where the runway repair was still in progress. At 0450 LT, the airport maintenance team reported to Juanda Tower controller that the runway repair had finished and the runway maintenance team had left the runway. No runway inspection was performed after the runway repair finished.The airport opened for traffic at 0500 as planned. Until 0606 hours, a total of eleven aircraft departed and one aircraft arrived. No pilot reported any foreign objects on the runway. The first pilot report of objects was near the intersection taxiway N5 and was made at 0609 LT which was after sunrise at 0559 LT. At 0615 LT, the controller contacted the Airport Facility Readiness personnel but received no reply. Thereafter the controller contacted the ARFF personnel and informed them of the pilot report of an object on the runway and requested a check. When the ARFF vehicle arrived near the runway the controller instructed to wait for three aircraft that were about to land.At 0620 LT, an ATR 72-600 (PK-WGK) with flight number IW1861 landed and impacted the chisel, which resulted in eight holes in the aircraft lower fuselage.The controller then decided to close the runway operation and instructed the ARFF personnel to enter and inspect the runway. The ARFF personnel found a compressor hose (about 10 meters long), a jack hammer (about 60 cm long) and chisel (about 4.5 kg) on the runway.Contributing Factors- The runway inspection that was performed while the runway maintenance has not been finished resulted in the object which were on dark color and found on dark surface did not properly inspect.- The insufficient information regarding the objects and the location might have made improper assessment to the consequences of the runway operation and delaying the object removal.11-06-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSC Indonesia ,2014

The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Houston-William P. Hobby Airport, TX (HOU) to Sugar Land Airport.Following an ILS approach, the Sugar Land tower controller cleared the flight to land on runway 35. The airplane reached 50 ft above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) at an indicated airspeed of 118 knots (KIAS). The airplane crossed the runway displaced threshold about 112 KIAS, and it touched down on the runway at 104 KIAS with about a 7-knot tailwind.About 1.6 seconds after touchdown of the main landing gear, the nose landing gear touched down and the pilot's brake pedal input increased, with intermediate oscillations, over a period of 7.5 seconds before reaching full pedal deflection. During this time, the airplane achieved its maximum wheel braking friction coefficient and deceleration. The cockpit voice recorder recorded both pilots express concern the that the airplane was not slowing. About 4 seconds after the airplane reached maximum deceleration, the pilot applied the emergency parking brake (EPB). Upon application of the EPB, the wheel speed dropped to zero and the airplane began to skid, which resulted in reverted-rubber hydroplaning, further decreasing the airplane's stopping performance. The airplane continued past the end of the runway, crossed a service road, and came to rest in a drainage ditch. Postaccident examination of the brake system and data downloaded from the brake control unit indicated that it functioned as commanded during the landing. The airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers or spoilers to aid in deceleration.The operator's standard operating procedures required pilots to conduct a go-around if the airspeed at 50 ft above TDZE exceeded 111 kts. Further, the landing distances published in the airplane flight manual (AFM) are based on the airplane slowing to its reference speed (Vref) of 101 KIAS at 50 ft over the runway threshold. The airplane's speed at that time exceeded Vref, which resulted in an increased runway distance required to stop; however, landing distance calculations performed in accordance with the AFM showed that the airplane should still have been able to stop on the available runway. An airplane performance study also showed that the airplane had adequate distance available on which to stop had the pilot continued to apply maximum braking rather than engage the EPB. The application of the EPB resulted in skidding, which increased the stopping distance.Although the runway was not contaminated with standing water at the time of the accident, the performance study revealed that the maximum wheel braking friction coefficient was significantly less than the values derived from the unfactored wet runway landing distances published in the AFM, and was more consistent with the AFM-provided landing distances for runways contaminated with standing water.It is likely that, based on the landing data in the AFM, the crew expected a faster rate of deceleration upon application of maximum braking; when that rate of deceleration was not achieved, the pilot chose to engage the EPB, which only further degraded the airplane's braking performance.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot's engagement of the emergency parking brake during the landing roll, which decreased the airplane's braking performance and prevented it from stopping on the available runway. Contributing to the pilot's decision to engage the emergency parking brake was the expectation of a faster rate of deceleration and considerably shorter wet runway landing distance provided by the airplane flight manual than that experienced by the crew upon touchdown and an actual wet runway friction level lower than the assumed runway fiction level used in the calculation of the stopping distances published in the airplane flight manual.""21-11-2014",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2014

The weather reported at the airport at 2020 hrs was wind 'calm', greater than 10 km visibility with fog patches, no significant cloud, temperature 5°C, dew point 4°C and QNH 1027 hPa. At 2024 hours, the crew was cleared to taxi to holding point J1 for a departure from runway 03. At 2028, the aircraft was at the holding point and was cleared for takeoff by the controller. The aircraft taxied towards the runway from J1 but lined up with the runway edge lights, which were positioned 3 m to the right of the edge of the runway. The aircraft began its takeoff run at 2030, passing over paved surface for approximately 248 m before running onto grass which lay beyond. The commander, who was the handling pilot, closed the thrust levers to reject the takeoff when he realised what had happened and the aircraft came to a halt on the grass having suffered major structural damage. The crew shut down the engines but were unable to contact ATC on the radio to tell the controller what had happened.The co-pilot moved from the flight deck into the passenger cabin and saw that no one had been injured. He vacated the aircraft through the rear baggage compartment and then helped the commander, who was still inside, to open the main exit door. The commander and the five passengers used the main exit to vacate the aircraft. Biggin Hill was originally a military airfield and at the beginning of runway 03 is a 250 m long and 36 m wide paved surface, with a 30° slant to the runway, called an Operational Readiness Platform (ORP). While there are no markings at the start of the ORP to indicate that aircraft should not enter this area, a section of the ORP between the runway and taxiway C has been painted with yellow hatching. Grass and weeds have grown in the gaps between the concrete segments in the ORP. Four surface-mounted red runway edge lights, evenly spaced 61 m apart, were positioned approximately 3 m from the white line that marked the edge of the runway. The most northerly light was located 30 m from the threshold of runway 03. Beyond the lights marking the runway threshold, white runway edge lights were mounted on poles located in the grass.",Private,,2014

Another half a minute later, the driver called the ground air traffic controller and informed that he was at the de-icing stand and requested clearance for crossing taxiway L and then further to the terminal. The ground air traffic controller asked him to keep clear, but after a SAS-aircraft had passed, he was cleared to drive towards the terminal.When the flight 4009 approached taxiway P, both pilots saw a de-icing truck standing out on the left hand side and just outside the double yellow taxiway edge line. The commander commented to his first officer that the truck stood close, but 'at least outside'. The commander considered that the truck was at safe distance, but chose to turn the aircraft a couple of meters to the right side of the center line on the taxiway to be extra safe. Shortly after the aircraft collided with the truck. There were no injuries, but the de-icing truck and the 1.6 meters outer part of the aircraft wing tip was severely damaged.After the collision, the crew informed the ground air traffic controller that the aircraft had hit the deicing truck. No immediate crash alarm was activated and the commander continued to taxi towards the terminal.CONCLUSION (translated from Norwegian)Significant investigation results with significance for aviation safetya) Avinor had insufficient controls to ensure that traffic regulations were complied with. Inappropriate practices were not detected or corrected. This contributed to the accident.b) The driver of deicing vehicle crossed the red safety line into the maneuvering area without obtaining clearance from the air traffic controller. This meant that the vehicle came into conflict with LN-RRS. The crossing of the security line was part of an unfortunate practice that had taken place over time, and also in violation of traffic regulations.c) The driver of the deicing vehicle did not specify that he had run out on taxiway ""P"" when he called the tower and requested clearance to cross taxiway ""L"". The ATCO assumed that the vehicle was parked behind the security line. This contributed to an air traffic controller not detecting the conflict between the deicing vehicle and the SAS aircraft.d) The commander of LN-RRS assumed incorrectly that it was a safe distance when the vehicle was parked on the edge of taxiway ""P"". The first officer dit not challenge the commander's decision to continue taxiing past the deicing vehicle.e) LN-RRS was not equipped with a wingtip camera that could have been an anti-collision aid to avoid collision on the ground.

Both pilots were not injured.During an ILS approach to runway 23 at Samara, the flaps were selected. However the crew did not use the Final Approach Checklist. They forgot to lower the undercarriage and did not check the position during final approach. The airplane's EGPWS issued several warnings ""Too Low Gear"", ""Caution Terrain"", ""Too Low Terrain"", and ""Terrain Ahead Pull Up"". The flight crew assumed these warning were false and ignored them. The aircraft landed gear up and slid to the right off the side of the runway. There was no fire.Cause (translated from Russian report)The cause of the accident with the aircraft Beechcraft B300 RA-02778 of Air Samara was failure of the crew during landing to carry out the standard operation of selecting the undercarriage down, which, despite the  ""BEFORE lANDING"" and ""lANDING"" checks and failure to react to the alarm system warning of an unreleased landing gear and the ground proximity warning system (Pull Up warnings), led to a landing without landing gear, skidding of the aircraft beyond the runway and causing damage. Skipping standard operations and the lack of response to the warning signal, most likely, was the result of a significant increase in emotional stress on the crew and critical narrowing attention caused by the discovery of a premature uncontrolled descend to a height well below the established approach altitude. Premature descent was made possible due to the insufficient level of professional training of the crew members (including part of the logic of the automatic flight modes and crew resource management principles), failure of standard operating procedures, lack of interaction and cross-checking, as well as limited experience flying on the B300 type aircraft. The low level of organization of flight operations at the airline did not allow time to identify and correct these shortcomings.25-11-2014",Cargo,MAK ,2014

As the result of a fault, during the cruising flight the air conditioning system unit 1 had to be reset once; thereafter it functioned normally for the remainder of the flight.After an uneventful descent and approach, D-ANFE touched down normally at 0802 on runway 14 at Zurich Airport in a light northerly wind. According to the flight crew's statements, the touchdown of the main landing gear and the nose landing gear occurred normally.After the nose landing gear wheels had come into contact with the runway approximately 1050 m after the runway threshold, the tyre of the right nose landing gear wheel separated from the nose landing gear during landing roll. The nose landing gear continued to slide on the wheel rims approximately 470 m after nosewheel touchdown. The commander later stated that shortly before reaching intersection H1 he had noticed that the steering was not functioning correctly.At 080412 the copilot then reported the following to the air traffic controller (ATCO) in the aerodrome control tower (TWR) ""Darwin two eight six uh we have a problem, we're on the runway trying to vacate."" He also requested the ATCO to summon the fire brigade because he suspected hot brakes.Steering was then performed by the flight crew by means of asymmetrical power setting of the two engines and by asymmetrical braking of the main landing gear wheels. The ATCO then instructed the crew to vacate the runway, if possible via intersection H1. This was also the flight crew's intention, since the vibrations increased during landing roll.The two flight attendants later stated that after touchdown the aircraft had deviated somewhat to the right and the landing roll-out felt as if the runway was very bumpy.The aircraft was brought to a standstill shortly afterwards at the Category (CAT) 1 stop bar on taxiway (TWY) H1. The fire-brigade arrived shortly afterwards at the aircraft and examined the brakes for overheating.Once the aircraft had come to a standstill, the copilot asked the ATCO for a runway inspection of runway 14 to be performed, since he suspected there had been problems with the tyres and consequently damage to the runway. The runway inspection was undertaken immediately; a tyre from the nose landing gear of D-ANFE was found on the centre line of runway 14 approximately 2080 m from the runway threshold. In addition, abrasion marks were found; however, these were not assessed as restrictive for the continued operation of runway 14.The accident is attributable to the fact that during landing the nose landing gear was not centred and so the two nose gear wheels could not turn freely. Subsequently it was no longer possible to exercise control via the nose landing gear steering system, as the nose landing gear was substantially damaged.The interaction of the following factors was determined as the most probable cause of the accident- a valve input lever of the differential control selector valve which had been fitted to the nose landing gear in an inverted state (rotated through 180°);- inadequate maintenance of the nose landing gear.The fact that the valve input lever can be attached incorrectly, in an inverted state (rotated through 180°) as a result of its structural design was determined to be a contributing factor.Though the small parts of the aircraft found on the runway during a runway inspection performed hours later did not contribute to the origin and history of the accident, they nevertheless constitute a factor to risk",International Scheduled Passenger,STSB Switzerland ,2014

On selecting the landing gear down during final approach, the crew noted an 'unsafe' indication for the nose leg. Recycling the gear effected no change in the condition, so the co-pilot called ATC to advise them of the situation and to request permission for the aircraft to over-fly the airfield at 500 ft. This allowed ATC personnel in the tower to confirm that the nose landing gear had not extended. The captain then flew the aircraft in a holding pattern overhead the airfield while he considered his options. He decided to return to Providenciales as he considered that the airport there was better equipped for emergencies and it was also the maintenance base for the aircraft.After contacting the airfield the captain entered a hold approximately 15 nm away while he attempted to extend the landing gear manually in accordance with the Emergency Checklist. This once again resulted in the main landing gear extending, but the nose leg remained in the up position. The captain then called his companys Flight Operations department who sought advice from the maintenance team. They suggested conducting a 'touch and go' on the main wheels in an attempt to shake the nose leg into the down position. The captain performed this manoeuvre but to no avail. Considering he had explored all the available options, he then took the aircraft back into a holding pattern while he briefed the co-pilot and passengers for an emergency landing. The captain declared an emergency and advised the tower of his intentions. The aircraft landed on its main landing gear and, as the speed decayed, the nose lowered to the runway surface, causing abrasion damage to the underside of the nose cone and nose gear doors. The propeller tips also contacted the runway. The aircraft was met by airfield Fire Service vehicles but there was no fire and the occupants vacated the aircraft without injury.PROBABLE CAUSE The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2014

The three occupants of the plane and three people inside a house were killed.The takeoff about 0945 from Chapel Hill-Horace Williams Airport, North Carolina, and the cruise portion of the flight were uneventful. Before beginning the descent, the pilot set the landing reference (Vref) speed at 92 knots, indicating that he used performance data for operation with the wing and horizontal stabilizer deice system turned off and an airplane landing weight less than the airplane's actual weight. Using the appropriate Normal Icing Conditions checklist and accurate airplane weight, the pilot should have flown the approach at 126 knots (a Vref of 121 knots +5 knots) to account for the icing conditions.The pilot failed to use the wing and horizontal stabilizer deice system during the approach, even after acknowledging the right seat passenger's observation that it was snowing when the airplane was about 2.8 nautical miles from the destination of Gaithersburg-Montgomery County Airport. The airplane was on approach to runway 14 when the ice accumulation caused an aerodynamic stall at a higher airspeed than would occur without ice accumulation. Because the deice system was not activated by the pilot before landing, the band indications (low speed awareness) on the airspeed display did not appropriately indicate the stall warning speed. Once the airplane stalled, its altitude was too low to recover.The airplane impacted three houses in the 19700 block of Drop Forge Lane about 3/4 mile from the approach end of the runway.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilot's conduct of an approach in structural icing conditions without turning on the airplane's wing and horizontal stabilizer deice system, leading to ice accumulation on those surfaces, and without using the appropriate landing performance speeds for the weather conditions and airplane weight, as indicated in the airplanes standard operating procedures, which together resulted in an aerodynamic stall at an altitude at which a recovery was not possible.""08-12-201408-12-201408-12-201408-12-201408-12-201408-12-201408-12-201408-12-2014",Private,NTSB ,2014

The aircraft had been parked in the open overnight adjacent to the hangar.The pilot reported that the grass runway surface was wet but not unduly soft or frozen, with occasional spots of water-logging and mud. The wind was light and from an easterly direction making runway 15 the preferred runway direction for departure. Following the removal of engine and pitot covers, the engine was started and the aircraft positioned away from the hangar to an area at the beginning of runway 15. Following extension of full flap to permit proper inspection of the flap mechanisms, the engine was shut down and a pre-flight inspection was carried out. Engine start was completed and included a check of the propeller control to ensure the pitch changing mechanism was functioning correctly. Takeoff checks were completed from memory and the takeoff run was commenced on runway 15.With takeoff power applied the aircraft appeared to accelerate normally. The pilot used a soft field technique where aft pressure was applied to the control yoke and the nose-wheel was lifted just off the runway surface as soon as possible. With the aircraft well established in the takeoff run, the pilot felt that the aircraft was not accelerating as expected. As a reserve of take-off power was available, he applied maximum available engine power, however there appeared to be no appreciable increase in acceleration.The pilot realised that continuing the take-off in these circumstances was not safe and that stopping in the remaining runway length would likely result in an overrun. As he was familiar with the airfield he was also aware that any overrun would result in the aircraft entering the ditch at the end of the runway. With few options remaining at that point, the pilot attempted to overfly the ditch at the departure end of the runway with the intention of stopping the aircraft in the adjacent field. As it passed over the ditch, the aircraft made contact with fence posts embedded in the hedge sustaining significant damage to the left elevator and fuselage underside. The aircraft came to rest at the far boundary of the adjacent field, incurring damage to the engine and propeller. The pilot shut down the engine and was able to evacuate the aircraft unaided.Probable CauseThe flaps remaining selected in the FULL position following pre-flight checks, which resulted in increased drag and reduced aircraft acceleration during the take-off roll.Contributory CauseThe decision to abandon the take-off was made too late in the take-off roll.13-12-201413-12-201413-12-201413-12-2014",Private,AAIU ,2014

All 156 passengers and six crew members on board were killed.The flight took off from runway 10 at Surabaya-Juanda Airport (SUB) at 0535 hours local time (2235 UTC). The airplane turned left, tracking 329° over the Java Sea. The planned cruising altitude of FL320 was reached about 0549. At 0600 the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) amber advisory AUTO FLT RUD TRV LIM 1 appeared. One minute later a failure on both Rudder Travel Limiter Units triggered a chime and master caution light. The ECAM message showed ""AUTO FLT RUD TRV LIM SYS"" (Auto Flight Rudder Travel Limiter System). The pilot in command read and performed the ECAM action to set the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) 1 and 2 push-buttons on the overhead panel to OFF then to ON one by one. Both Rudder Travel Limiter Units returned to function normally.Upon entering the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) over the TAVIP waypoint at 0611 the flight contacted Jakarta ACC. The flight stated that they were deviating to the left of their planned route along airway M635 to avoid clouds and requested a climb to FL380. The requested climb was not possible due to other traffic but the flight was cleared to climb to FL340.At 0613, a single chime sounded and the amber ECAM message ""AUTO FLT RUD TRV LIM SYS"" was again displayed. This was the third failure on both Rudder Travel Limiter Units on this flight. The pilots performed the ECAM actions and the system returned to function normally.At 0615, the fourth failure on both Rudder Travel Limiter Units occurred and triggered ECAM message ""AUTO FLT RUD TRV LIM SYS"", chime and master caution light.At 0616 the flight was cleared by Jakarta Radar to climb to FL340 but there was no reply. The Jakarta Radar controller then called the pilot for several times but received no reply.Meanwhile on the flight deck, the pilot in command decided not to follow the same ECAM actions as before to rectify the failure. He had recently observed a ground engineer resetting the FAC Circuit Breakers (CB) to rectify the rudder travel limiter failure and assumed he could use the same method in flight. This action however was not allowed in flight. The consequences of resetting FAC CBs in flight are not described in Airbus documents. It requires good understanding of the aircraft system to be aware of the consequences.Following a reset of the circuit breakers, several master cautions were triggered in relation to FAC's 1 and 2.After electrical interruption the autopilot and the auto-thrust then disengaged. Flight control law reverted from Normal Law to Alternate Law. The aircraft started to roll to the left up to 54° angle of bank. Nine seconds after the autopilot disengaged, the right side-stick activated. The delayed response of the pilot flying was likely due to his attention not being directed to the PFD as many events occurred at this time. He may have been startled when he realized the unusual attitude of the aircraft.After the right side-stick activated, the aircraft roll angle reduced to 9° left. This rapid right rolling movement might cause an excessive roll sensation to the right. The pilot flying may have experienced spatial disorientation and over-corrected by shifting the side stick to the left which caused the aircraft rolled back to the left up to 50°The input on his side-stick was mostly pitch up and the aircraft climbed up to approximately 38,000 feet with a climb rate of up to 11,000 feet per minute.The aircraft pitch reached 24° up. The pilot in command then stated ""pull down...pull down"" however the input on the pilot flying's side stick was backward and increased resulting in the AOA increasing up to a maximum of 48° up. At 061717 the stall warning activated and continued until the end of the CVR recording.In a response the pilot in command applied nose down commands with his side stick while the pilot flying's side stick input was mostly at maximum pitch up until the end of the recordingAt 061741 the aircraft reached the highest altitude of 38,500 feet and the largest roll angle of 104° to the left. The aircraft then lost altitude with a descent rate of up to 20,000 feet per minute.At approximately 29,000 feet the aircraft attitude was wings level with pitch and roll angles of approximately zero with the airspeed varied between 100 and 160 knots. The Angle of Attack (AOA) was almost constant at approximately 40° up. The aircraft then lost altitude with an average rate of 12,000 feet per minute until the aircraft impacted the sea.On December 30 pieces of debris and bodies were recovered from the sea. On January 12 and 13, 2015 the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) were retrieved. On January 14 the main fuselage was located by a Singapore Navy ship.Contributing factors- The cracking of a solder joint of both channel A and B resulted in loss of electrical continuity and led to RTLU failure.- The existing maintenance data analysis led to unresolved repetitive faults occurring with shorter intervals. The same fault occurred 4 times during the flight.- The flight crew action to the first 3 faults in accordance with the ECAM messages. Following the fourth fault, the FDR recorded different signatures that were similar to the FAC CB's being reset resulting in electrical interruption to the FAC's. - The electrical interruption to the FAC caused the autopilot to disengage and the flight control logic to change from Normal Law to Alternate Law, the rudder deflecting 2° to the left resulting the aircraft rolling up to 54° angle of bank.- Subsequent flight crew action leading to inability to control the aircraft in the- Alternate Law resulted in the aircraft departing from the normal flight envelope and entering prolonged stall condition that was beyond the capability of the flight crew to recover.28-12-201428-12-201428-12-201428-12-201428-12-2014",International Scheduled Passenger,NTSC Indonesia ,2014

The flight originated at Bucharest International Airport (OTP), Romania and was operated as a non-scheduled charter. The landing reference speed for the approach was 145 knots. Due to the gusty weather conditions, the flight crew added 10 knots to this for their approach speed and conducted a visual approach using the visual approach slope indicator as guidance. The airspeed fluctuated during the approach between 162 knots and 138 knots and engine thrust varied accordingly between about 86% N1 and 40% N1 on approach.The captain stated that the flight was on speed and glide path at 500 feet above the ground but at about 200 feet above the ground, the flight started to move above the glide path and airspeed started to increase. To compensate, the captain reduced engine power and then heard a ""sink rate"" aural alert when passing through about 50 feet. Flight recorder data indicated the engine N1 decreased to 40%, with throttles at forward idle position, at about 110 feet above the ground, and remained there until after touchdown. The airplane touched down at 140 knots and a nose up pitch attitude of 8.9 °, increasing to 9.5° immediately after touchdown.Guidance included in the operator's training manuals indicated that normal touchdown attitude should be between 4 and 6 degrees nose up. Additionally, guidance indicated that thrust should be managed on approach to maintain reference speed, plus any wind additive, until the beginning of the flare. After reaching the flare, thrust levers should be retarded smoothly to idle with main gear touchdown ideally occurring simultaneously with thrust levers reaching idle.An analysis of calculated vertical and horizontal wind effect indicated an existing updraft transitioned to a downdraft and a headwind component transitioned to a tailwind component during the last 5 seconds prior to touchdown.Probable cause ""The early reduction of engine thrust that resulted in an excessive sink rate and nose high pitch attitude during the landing flare. Contributing to the accident was a significant change in the vertical and horizontal wind components just prior to touchdown.""",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2014

Both crew members sustained fatal injuries.The Learjet took off from Hohn Air Base, Germany at 1304 to carry out a Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) military intercept and identification exercise with the German Air Force.At 1420 a formation of two Eurofighter EF2000 Typhoon jets took off from Nörvenich Air Base. The jets were given radar guidance to intercept the Learjet as part of the exercise. At 1426 the formation reported the target in sight. The formation was cleared to climb to the Learjet's altitude. At the same time the Learjet crew were informed that the Eurofighters had visual contact.One of the Eurofighters, serial 30+91, then closed in on the Learjet while the other one kept a distance of 2 Nautical Miles. At 1429 the first Eurofighter pilot began transmitting information about the Learjet (registration mark, colours) to the military controller.At the same time the Learjet crew noticed the Eurofighter on their left hand side.At 1434 the military controller contacted the Learjet crew ""...for your information the QRA will perform an obey-check on your left side and after three minutes you should obey.""After four minutes the controller told the Learjet crew ""... for your information, you overwhelmed the hijacker and now you want to obey the orders of the QRA and call them on the guard.""The Eurofighter pilot wiggled the wings and initiated a left hand turn. The Learjet crew disconnected the autopilot and followed the Eurofigher in the left hand turn.The Learjet was flying with a 46° left bank angle and the Eurofighter at a 26° left bank angle when a collision occurred. The Learjet entered an uncontrolled descent and impacted terrain. The pilot of the Eurofighter issued a Mayday call ""Mayday, mayday, mayday...crashed with Learjet probably [...] left hand turn direct inbound Nörvenich declaring emergency.""

The aircraft was operated by Malaysia Airlines on behalf of Turkish Airlines. The first officer was pilot flying.The crew expected a landing on runway 04 and briefed the expected taxi routing after landing. The runway would be vacated either using Taxiway C, B or even A, taxi along the parallel Taxiway P, making a right turn to Taxiway H and then proceed to the parking bay.However, upon landing on runway 04, Astana ATC cleared the crew to vacate the runway via taxiway C, then taxi on the apron to Gate 2. Upon entering the apron area, the crew observed that there were two separate taxi lanes adjoining Taxiway C; one leading towards the main terminal and the other towards the open bays across the terminal. These taxi lanes were not given any specific designation, either on the ground or on the airport charts that were provided. As the crew were approaching the intersection between Taxiway C and the two unnamed taxiways, they had noticed a wide bodied aircraft located at around Gate 10 being pushed back. This appeared to pose as a potential obstruction should the crew proceed to taxi along the inner taxi lane. Incidentally, there were no aircraft parked in any of the bays between 15 and 21, thus giving the crew a perception of clear taxi path along the outer taxi lane.The crew had not attempted to clarify with ATC Ground Controller on which taxi lane to use. Since there was no specific instruction from ATC on which taxi lane to use, and considering that there is no restrictions listed on the Airport Operational Information (AOI) with regards to ground movement of A330 aircraft on the apron taxi lanes, the crew decided to follow the outer taxi lane in order to keep clear of the aircraft at Gate 10.As they were turning into the outer lane, they saw the light pole on the left hand side of aircraft but were sure that there was sufficient clearance to clear the pole. As the aircraft was taxiing on the centre line of the outer taxi lane, they felt a jolt and immediately stopped the aircraft.The left wing of the aircraft had hit a lamp-post and caused it to topple. Apart from the light pole, the aircraft wing also came into contact with another smaller pole with a CCTV mounted.The CCTV was knocked off and the pole scratched the underside of the wing. The impact resulted in the number 6 slat leading edge being damaged. At this point, the crew were told by the Astana Ground Control to hold position and wait for a 'Follow-me' car to assist in the taxi.Probable Cause1. There was no taxiway restriction prescribed on either the Astana AIP or the Aerodrome charts. Maximum wingspan limitation was stated only for the remote parking bay.2. There was a lack of information on LIDO AGC which resulted in ambiguity.3. There are numerous unnamed taxiways at Astana International Airport.4. There was a mistaken belief by the flight crew that the aircraft will have enough separation from stationary object as long as they are on the taxiway centerline.5. The flight crew was not fully aware of the proper obstacle clearance estimation during taxi.6. The non-specific ATC instruction and lack of monitoring promotes the potential for error by flight crew.",Cargo,AAIB Malaysia ,2014

All four on board were killed.The airplane departed runway 6 and climbed slowly attaining no more than about 50 feet above ground. The flight path continuously deviated left of the extended runway centerline at an airspeed of 100 knots, which was also the lift off airspeed. The airplane subsequently collided with the building, about 2.1 kilometers north-northeast of the runway departure end. The airplane impact attitude with the building was about a 120° left roll angle.The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data revealed aural warning alerts began about 8 seconds after the takeoff roll was initiated of which thereafter the flight crew also made reference to indications associated with visual warning alerts. However, despite the alerts the flight crew continued the takeoff. The flight data recorder data showed that no. 1 propeller rpm reduced from 100% to 50% where it stabilized at for the remainder of the flight. The decrease in propeller rpm corresponded with an increase of the no. 1 engine torque to about 110% along with the occurrence of the aural warning alerts. According to radar data, the liftoff occurred near the runway end. The no. 2 engine operated normally throughout the entire flight.The day before the accident, the airplane was repositioned from Nairobi-Wilson Airport to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The flight was commanded by the accident captain. During that flight, the CVR data disclosed warning alerts similar to those of the accident flight accompanied by the flight crew discussion on the interpretation and significance of the alerts. The investigation did not reveal any actions undertaken before the accident to address any irregularities that may have been associated with the warning alerts during the repositioning flight.Calculations of the aircraft weight and balance that included the post-accident measured weights of the cargo determined that at takeoff the airplane weight was about 500kg over the maximum certified gross weight.Probable CauseThe probable cause of the accident was the decision by the crew to conduct the flight with a known mechanical problem and their failure to abort or reject the takeoff after receiving twenty seven cautions.02-07-2014",Cargo,AAID Kenya ,2014

All 298 on board were killed. Flight MH17 departed the gate at Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands at 1213 hours local time, bound for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was airborne at 1231 (1031 UTC) from runway 36C and reached a cruising altitude of FL310 at 1253 (1053 UTC). Ninety minutes into the flight, at 1201 UTC and just prior to entering Ukrainian airspace, the flight climbed to FL330. According to the flight plan, flight MH17 would continue at the flight level until the waypoint PEKIT, which is on the Flight Information Region (FIR) boundary between Kiev FIR (UKBV) and Dnipropetrovsk FIR (UKDV). From waypoint PEKIT the flight plan indicates a climb to FL350 on airway L980 for the remaining part over Ukraine.According to ATC data, at 1253 UTC the aircraft was flying within the Dnipropetrovsk FIR, Control Sector 2, at FL330, controlled by Dnipro Control. At that time, Dnipro Control asked whether MH17 was able to climb to FL350 in accordance with the flight plan and also to clear a potential separation conflict with other traffic in the area.This traffic was Singapore Airlines flight SQ351 from Copenhagen, a Boeing 777, flying at FL330 and approaching from behind.The crew replied they were unable to comply and requested to maintain at FL330. This was agreed by Dnipro Control. As an alternative to solve the separation conflict, the other traffic climbed to FL350. According to ATC data, at 1300 UTC the crew of flight MH17 requested to divert the track 20 NM to the left, due to weather. This also was agreed by Dnipro Control, after which the crew requested whether FL340 was available.Dnipro control informed MH17 that FL340 was not available at that moment and instructed the flight to maintain FL330 for a while. At 1307 UTC the flight was transferred to Dnipropetrovsk CTA 4, also with call sign Dnipro Control.At 131953 UTC, radar data showed that the aircraft was 3.6 NM north of centreline of airway L980 having deviated left of track, when Dnipro Control directed the crew to alter their route directly to waypoint RND due to other traffic. The crew acknowledged at 131956 hrs. At 13.2000 hrs, Dnipro Control transmitted an onward ATC clearance to ""proceed direct to TIKNA after RND"", no acknowledgement was received.Data from the Flight Data Recorder and the Digital Cockpit Voice Recorder both stopped at 132003 hrs. No distress messages were received from the aircraft.The airplane apparently broke up in mid-air as debris was found in a large area.

The cockpit and lower nose section came down in a sunflower field in Rozsypne, nearly four miles (6,5 km) west-southwest of Hrabove. The L2 and R2 doors along with various parts of the fuselage were found near Petropavlivka, about 5 miles (8 km) west of Hrabove.At the point of last contact it was flying 1000 feet above airspace that had been classified as restricted by Ukrainian authorities as a result of ongoing fighting in the area. In the preceding days before the accident two Ukraine Air Force aircraft that were shot down in the region a Su-25 and an An-26 transport plane.Causes of the crasha. On 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines operated flight MH17, an airworthy Boeing 777-200 with the registration 9M-MRD, in cruise flight near the Ukrainian/Russian border at 33,000 feet, under the control of Ukrainian Air Traffic Control and was operated by a competent and qualified crew.b. At 13.2003 hours (15.2003 CET) a warhead detonated outside and above the left hand side of the cockpit of flight MH17. It was a 9N314M warhead carried on the 9M38-series of missiles as installed on the Buk surface-to-air missile system.c. Other scenarios that could have led to the disintegration of the aeroplane were considered, analysed and excluded based on the evidence available.d. The impact killed the three persons in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the forward part of the aeroplane leading to an in-flight break-up. The break-up resulted in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres between the village of Petropavlivka and the town of Hrabove, Ukraine. All 298 occupants lost their lives.17-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-201417-07-2014",International Scheduled Passenger,Dutch Safety Board ,2014

There were 58 persons on board. Ten passengers survived the accident.Flight GE222 had departed from Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH) at 1743 on a scheduled domestic flight to Magong Airport, Penghu Islands, Taiwan. The flight had been delayed from 1600 hours because of poor weather as a result of Typhoon Matmo that was passing through the area. The flight arrived near the Penghu Islands at 1811 and entered a holding pattern to the northeast. The Magong airport has a single runway 02/20. Runway 02 offers an ILS approach, while for runway 20 a VOR/DME approach is available.At 1827 the following weather information was passed on to the crew runway 02 wind from 210 degrees at 5 knots, gusting to 11 knots; runway 20 wind from 190 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 15 knots. Visibility was 800 meters.The crew then requested a runway 02 ILS approach and proceeded towards the south. At 1843 a preceding UNI Air ATR-72-600, flight 647, requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This probably made the crew change their minds, since they subsequently also requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This was approved. The UNI Air flight landed at 1856.At 1903 the controller cleared the flight to land on runway 20, reporting wind from 250 degrees at 19 knots.At 190544 the autopilot was disengaged an at about 190558, the aircraft began to deviate to the left, descending below the glidepath. The flight had deviated about 340 m the left of the extended runway centreline when, at 190611, the flight crew reported they were going around. About two seconds later the airplane contacted 5-6 m high trees, cutting a swath for about 100 meters. The airplane remained airborne for about 200 m until impacting a residential area. According to the Magong Airport flight schedule, 55 out of 66 flights to Magong were cancelled on July 23.Findings Related to Probable CausesFlight Operations1. The flight crew did not comply with the published runway 20 VOR non-precision instrument approach procedures at Magong Airport with respect to the minimum descent altitude (MDA). The captain, as the pilot flying, intentionally descended the aircraft below the published MDA of 330 feet in the instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) without obtaining the required visual references.2. The aircraft maintained an altitude between 168 and 192 feet before and just after overflying the missed approach point (MAPt). Both pilots spent about 13 seconds attempting to visually locate the runway environment, rather than commencing a missed approach at or prior to the MAPt as required by the published procedures.3. As the aircraft descended below the minimum descent altitude (MDA), it diverted to the left of the inbound instrument approach track and its rate of descent increased as a result of the flying pilot's control inputs and meteorological conditions. The aircraft's hazardous flight path was not detected and corrected by the crew in due time to avoid the collision with the terrain, suggesting that the crew lost situational awareness about the aircraft's position during the latter stages of the approach.4. During the final approach, the heavy rain and associated thunderstorm activity intensified producing a maximum rainfall of 1.8 mm per minute. The runway visual range (RVR) subsequently reduced to approximately 500 meters. The degraded visibility significantly reduced the likelihood that the flight crew could have acquired the visual references to the runway environment during the approach.5. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management were less than effective. That compromised the safety of the flight. The first officer did not comment about or challenge the fact that the captain had intentionally descended the aircraft below the published minimum descent altitude (MDA). Rather, the first officer collaborated with the captain's intentional descent below the MDA. In addition, the first officer did not detect the aircraft had deviated from the published inbound instrument approach track or identify that those factors increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) event.6. None of the flight crew recognized the need for a missed approach until the aircraft reached the point (72 feet, 0.5 nautical mile beyond the missed approach point) where collision with the terrain became unavoidable.7. The aircraft was under the control of the flight crew when it collided with foliage 850 meters northeast of the runway 20 threshold, two seconds after the go around decision had been made. The aircraft sustained significant damage and subsequently collided with buildings in a residential area.  Due to the high impact forces and post-impact fire, the crew and most passengers perished.8. According to the flight recorders data, non-compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) was a repeated practice during the occurrence flight. The crew's recurring non-compliance with SOPs constituted an operating culture in which high risk practices were routine and considered normal.9. The non-compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) breached the obstacle clearances of the published procedure, bypassed the safety criteria and risk controls considered in the design of the published procedures, and increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) event.Weather10. Magong Airport was affected by the outer rainbands of Typhoon Matmo at the time of the occurrence. The meteorological conditions included thunderstorm activities of heavy rain, significant changes in visibility, and changes in wind direction and speed.23-07-201423-07-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ASC ,2014
24-JUL-2014,DC-9-83 (MD-83),EC-LTV,"Swiftair, op.for Air Algérie",116,near Gossi,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20140724-0,En route (ENR),Destroyed,Loss of control,"A McDonnell Douglas MD-83 passenger plane, registration EC-LTV was destroyed when it crashed 80 km northwest of Gossi, Mali. All 116 occupants sustained fatal injuries.The airplane was operated by Spanish airline Swiftair on behalf of Air Algérie as flight 5017 from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to Algiers, Algeria.Flight 5017 took off from runway 22 at Ouagadougou Airport (OUA) at 0115 UTC (and local time). Following a right turn after takeoff the aircraft headed to the EPOPO point and started climbing to the planned cruising altitude of FL310.At an altitude of about 10,500 ft, autopilot 1 was engaged, the autothrottle having been active since takeoff. Nine minutes after takeoff, the crew said that they were passing through FL145 and that they estimated EPEPO point at 0138.At 0128, the airplane was transferred to the Ouagadougou CCR and the crew said that they were turning to the left on heading 356° to avoid an bad weather in the area.During the climb towards FL310, the crew made three heading alterations to the left (of 28°, of 4° then of 8°), then an alteration to the right of 36° to return to heading 019°, close to the initial heading.At 0137, the airplane levelled off at FL310 at Mach 0.740. The autopilot then maintained the altitude and heading, while the speed was controlled by the autothrottle. At the same time, the airplane was transferred to the Niamey CCR. In the two minutes following level-off, the airplane's speed increased.From 1 h 38 min 34, and for about 30 seconds, the autothrottle was in MACH ATL mode. This mode automatically engaged because the thrust needed to reach the Mach speed selected by the pilots was greater than the EPR limit.The engines' EPR stabilised around 1.92 and the Mach changed from 0.758 to 0.762. The autothrottle then returned to MACH mode and the airplane continued to accelerate up to Mach 0.775.At 013936, the airplane's speed started to decrease. About one minute later the autothrottle changed back to MACH ATL while the Mach was 0.752. Following that, the altitude remained stable, pitch and EPR increased progressively, while the engines' N1 remained stable and the speed continued to decrease.Between 014138 and 014429, the Niamey CCR and flight AH5017 tried to get in contact, but did not manage to do so. Flight RAM543K offered to act as the intermediary. The crew of flight AH5017 said, at 014429, that they were at FL310 on a weather avoidance manoeuvre. The Niamey CCR heard this radio exchange and asked them to call back passing GAO and to transmit estimates for MOKAT point. No answer, nor any other messages from flight AH5017, reached the Niamey CCR.At 0144, EPR and N1 fluctuations on both engines appeared for about 45 seconds. Then, for about 25 seconds, the EPR decreased then increased again on two occasions from 1.6 to about 2.5. The N1s varied between 70% and 91%. Some roll oscillations between 4° to the left and to the right appeared. The autothrottle disengaged between 014502 and 014506. This disengagement occurred between the first and second EPR variations.At 014506, the calibrated airspeed was 203 kt, the Mach 0.561 and the airplane started to descend. Pitch increased until it reached 10° at 014517, then decreased slightly while the deflection of the elevators and the position of the trimmable horizontal stabiliser continued pitching up. The EPR and the engines' RPM started to decrease towards values corresponding to idle. The roll oscillations continued and the speed continued to decrease.At 014535, the autopilot disengaged. The altitude decreased by about 1,150 ft in relation to the flight level, the calibrated airspeed was 162 kt, the Mach 0.439 and both engines were almost at idle. The airplane's pitch began to decrease and the bank was increasing to the left.The airplane's pitch and bank were then subject to significant changes. They reached, respectively, 80° nose-down and 140° bank to the left. The airplane was pitched nose-down and banked to the left until it struck the ground. The heading decreased continuously and the flight control surfaces remained mainly deflected pitch-up and in the direction of a bank to the right. Around twenty seconds before the impact, the engine speed and EPR increased again and reached values close to maximum thrust.Analysis of the recorded parameters by the flight data recorder, indicates that about two minutes after the leveling off at FL310, the engine pressure ratio (EPR) value became become incoherent in relation to other engine parameters. This anomaly occurred on the right engine and about 55 seconds later on the left engine. These false readings were probably caused by an obstruction of the pressure sensors located on the nose cone of the engine, presumably by icing. This icing may have been caused by the presence of cold, moist air on the edge of the storm cell, considering the fact that none of the anti-icing systems were activated.Due to the incorrect values, the auto-throttle tried to maintain a lower thrust than was necessary. The aircraft lost speed and developed a tendency to descend. The autopilot, engaged in altitude hold mode, then attempted to raise the nose in order to maintain altitude. The aircraft ultimately stalled.The aeroplane speed, piloted by the autothrottle, decreased due to the obstruction of the pressure sensors located on the engine nose cones, probably caused by ice crystals. The autopilot then gradually increased the angle of attack to maintain altitude until the aeroplane stalled. The stall was not recovered. The aeroplane retained a pitch-down attitude and left bank angle down to the ground, while the control surfaces remained mainly deflected pitch up and in the direction of a bank to the right. The aeroplane hit the ground at high speed.The accident was the result of a combination of the following events- the non-activation of the engine anti-icing systems- the obstruction of the Pt2 pressure sensors, probably by ice crystals, generating erroneous EPR values that caused the autothrottle to limit the thrust produced by the engines to a level below that required to maintain the aeroplane at FL310.- the crew's late reaction to the decrease in speed and to the erroneous EPR values, possibly linked to the work load associated with avoiding the convective zone and communication difficulties with air traffic control.- the crew's lack of reaction to the appearance of buffet, the stickshaker and the stall warning.- the lack of appropriate inputs on the flight controls to recover from a stall situation.These events could be explained by a combination of the following factors- The FCOM procedure relating to the activation of the anti-icing systems that was not adapted to Pt2 pressure sensor obstruction by ice crystals- Insufficient information for operators on the consequences of a blockage of the Pt2 pressure sensor by icing- The stickshaker and the stall warning triggering logic that led these devices to be triggered belatedly in relation to the aeroplane stall in cruise;- the autopilot logic that enables it to continue to give pitch-up commands beyond the stall angle, thereby aggravating the stall situation and increasing the crew's difficulties in recovery.The absence of a usable CVR recording limited the possibility of analysing the crews behaviour during the flight.Specifically, it was not possible to study CRM aspects or to evaluate the possible contribution of the employment context and the experience of the crew members.24-07-201424-07-201424-07-2014June 1996SU-ZCAMcDonnell Douglas23 August 1996SU-ZCAHeliopolis Airlines9 December 1997N190ANAWAS13 February 1998HK-4137XAvianca17 August 2000N190ANAvianca30 June 2004N190ANAvianca10 December 2004N190ANAvianca22 December 2006N190ANAWAS19 January 2007LV-BHNAustral Líneas Aéreas15 May 2008LV-BHNAustral Líneas Aéreas28 August 2008LV-BHNAustral Líneas Aéreas01 February 2012LV-BHNAustral Líneas Aéreas30 March 2012N190ANAWAS24 October 2012EC-LTVSwiftair04 December 2012EC-LTVSwiftair01 January 2013EC-LTVSwiftair27 February 2013EC-LTVSwiftair20 June 2014EC-LTVSwiftair",International Scheduled Passenger,CEAIAC ,2014
25-JUL-2014,DHC-6 Twin Otter 300,N190GC,Grand Canyon Airlines,0,Boulder City...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20140725-0,Taxi (TXI),Minor,Ground collision Damaged on the ground,"A landing Eurocopter EC-130, N154GC, and a taxiing DHC-6, N190GC collided at Boulder City Municipal Airport, NV (BLD). Neither the two pilots on board the airplane, nor the pilot and six passengers aboard the helicopter, were injured. The helicopter, operated by Grand Canyon Helicopters as an aerial sightseeing flight, sustained substantial damage. The airplane, operated by Grand Canyon Airlines, was beginning a repositioning flight.According to the EC-130 pilot, he was inbound from the south, and planned to land on the airport location designated as ""Spot 2,"" which was a dedicated helicopter arrival and departure location. He followed the company-designated arrival procedure, in which the helicopter flew a descending pattern first north along the centerline of taxiway A, and then west along the centerline of taxiway D to Spot 2. Spot 2 was a 50-foot painted square situated on the airport ramp. Taxiway D was 40 feet wide, was oriented approximately east-west, and comprised the southern perimeter of the same ramp. The center of Spot 2 was located about 50 feet north of the centerline of taxiway D. Since Boulder City was not equipped with an operating air traffic control tower, the pilot communicated his positions and intentions via radio transmissions on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The helicopter pilot first saw the airplane when the helicopter was making the left turn from north to west near the junction of taxiways A and D. At that time, the airplane was moving south, towards taxiway D, along a taxi line just east of Spot 1, on ramp about 600 feet east of Spot 2. The airplane crew announced their intentions on CTAF to taxi to runway 15 via taxiway D. The helicopter pilot reported that the last time he saw the airplane prior to the accident was as the helicopter overflew the intersection of taxiway D and the taxi line just east of Spot 1. At that time, the airplane was turning westbound onto taxiway D. The helicopter pilot realized the potential for conflict, since the two were now both traveling westbound along taxiway D. The helicopter pilot stated that he ""immediately"" queried on CTAF whether the airplane crew had him in sight. The pilot heard a ""double click"" on the CTAF frequency, which he interpreted as acknowledgement by the airplane crew that they had him in sight. Based on this information, the pilot was convinced that the airplane was behind him and that its flight crew had him in sight.The helicopter pilot therefore continued his descent along the centerline of taxiway D towards Spot 2. About 8 to 10 seconds later, as the helicopter came almost abeam of Spot 2, the pilot began a right pedal turn to traverse to and set down on Spot 2. At the commencement of that pedal turn, the pilot simultaneously spotted the wings and nose of the airplane through his chin windows, and felt an"" impact."" He stopped the turn and descent, transitioned to Spot 2, descended, and landed on the ramp. The flight crew of the airplane was unaware that there had been a collision, and they continued with their taxi-out and departure from Boulder City. The airplane was recalled by company personnel once they learned of the collision.Probable Cause The airplane flight crews failure to exercise the necessary vigilance and precautions and yield the right of way to the landing helicopter, which resulted in the airplane colliding with the helicopter. Contributing to the accident was the helicopter pilots decision to continue his descent without positively determining that the airplane did not pose a collision hazard.",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2014

There were no injuries among the 171 passengers and six crew members.The pilots report that they flew an ILS approach for a Flaps 30 landing on runway 04 at Stansted Airport. At 500 feet, with the aircraft stabilised on the approach, the co-pilot, who was pilot flying, disconnected the autopilot and then the autothrottle and continued flying manually to land.The wind in the final 200 feet before landing varied slightly from the ATC reported wind of 330° at 7 kt and the co-pilot was applying left aileron, into wind, which resulted in a touchdown on the left main landing gear first. The aircraft then bounced 5 feet back into the air. The thrust levers were retarded and reached idle approximately 2 seconds after the initial touchdown and the speed brakes were deployed.Then there was a second much firmer touchdown, during which the aircraft had a high-nose attitude. This landing occurred at a deceleration of 2.07g and the pitch reached a peak of 8.9° nose up. The landing rollout was normal. After shutdown, the cabin crew commented that the second landing was hard, so the captain conducted a visual inspection of the aircraft and found damage to the lower rear fuselage.The visible damage consisted of a large scrape along the skin of the tail section of the aircraft; numerous stringers and frames beneath the surface were also damaged, requiring a substantial repair before the aircraft was returned to service on August 17, 2014.The captain considered that the aircraft bounced because the first touchdown occurred with higher than idle thrust. When the thrust lever was selected to idle during the bounce, the speedbrakes deployed automatically; this caused a loss of lift, the nose of the aircraft to pitch up, and the subsequent tailstrike on touchdown.No Probable Cause statement was issued by the AAIB",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2014

There were no injuries to the 174 persons onboard. The airplane sustained substantial damage. According to the operator, the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring. The accident flight was the second flight of the day for both crew members. The climb, cruise, and descent portions of the flight were uneventful. The airplane was configured for a flaps 30 landing with the autopilot off for the visual approach to runway 27. The target airspeed for the landing was 130 knots, 5 knots above VREF.An airplane performance study was completed based on the FDR data from the flight. The study showed the wind was constant during the final descent to the runway with about a 4-knot headwind component. At about 50 feet radio altitude, the FO began to gradually pull back on the column until the elevators deflected 12 degrees airplane nose up at touchdown. Touchdown occurred with a sink rate near 0, a pitch attitude of about 6 degrees and an airspeed of 120 knots (5 knots below VREF). After touchdown, thrust was commanded to idle and the speedbrakes were deployed. The FO then began to gradually release column backpressure; however, pitch attitude continued to increase towards the gear-struts-compressed tail strike pitch attitude. The airplane's pitch attitude eventually exceeded the gear struts compressed tail strike attitude of 10.5 degrees. The FO commanded reverse thrust as the tail strike occurred and then increased to maximum reverse thrust after derotation had occurred.Published Flight Operations Technical Bulletins issued by the manufacturer in 1988 and 1990 instructed pilots to immediately lower the nose after touchdown (i.e. apply forward pressure) and warned pilots that bleeding off airspeed below VREF prior to touchdown will increase body attitude and thereby increase the likelihood of a tail strike. In this accident, touchdown occurred about 5 knots below VREF and the nose-up elevator remained for nearly 3.5 seconds, causing the aft fuselage to contact the runway.Inspection of the airplane revealed substantial abrasion damage to two aft, lower skin panels spanning an area about 4 feet long by 1.5 feet wide. In addition, the forward and aft lower chords on the aft pressure bulkhead (APB) were deformed and the lower APB web was buckled.Probable Cause ""The first officer's failure to maintain the correct airspeed and pitch attitude during landing that resulted in a tailstrike.""29-07-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2014

The aircraft operated flight 5915 to Tabas, Iran, carrying 42 passengers and six crew members. It was heavily loaded and 190 kg over the maximum takeoff weight.Weather was normal for Mehrabad Airport with an ambient air temperature 35°C and a 10 knot crosswind.For departure the crew selected 10° of flaps, which was not approved according to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the airline. Additionally the crew did not set the elevator trim tab and the rudder trim tab to the positions complying with the requirements of the AFM. The elevator trim tab was set to -2° instead of 0° or +6° depending on the aircraft CG position. The rudder trim tab was not set to the neutral position, its angle before take-off was about -3°.The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 29L. During the takeoff roll, the no.2 engine suffered an automatic shutdown. Two seconds later the captain rotated the aircraft at the speed of about 219 km/h (whereas 224 km/h was the recommended speed).Immediately after rotating, the captain noticed that the engine had failed and stated this to the co-pilot. After lift-off the aircraft deviated to the right from runway course, climbed around 40 m. The failure continuous warning chime and light then activated by about 14 seconds delay. The no.2 propeller was not feathered by the flight crew and it took 17 seconds, after engine shutdown, for the auto feather to kick in.By then the aircraft already had lost airspeed and altitude. The aircraft stalled and crashed in the area of urban utility service at the side of a highway, at a distance of about 3000 m from the runway threshold. The aircraft broke up and a fire broke out, destroying most of the fuselage.The IrAn-140 is an Antonov 140 turboprop aircraft, built under license by HESA in Iran. Sepahan Air, which is a division of HESA, operated six IrAn-140's at the time of the accident.CausesThe accident investigation team determined that the main cause of this accident was combination of1. Electronic engine control (SAY-2000) failure simultaneously with engine No. 2 shutdown, just about 2 seconds before aircraft lift-off.2. AFM Confusing performance chart resulted the pilots relying on performance calculation that, significantly over-estimate the aircraft MTOM.Contributing Factors to the accident were1.

13-AUG-2014,Cessna 560XLS+ Citation XLS+,PR-AFA,AF Andrade Empr. e Part.,7,"Santos, SP",https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20140813-0,Approach (APR),Destroyed,,"A Cessna 560XLS+ Citation Excel corporate jet, registration PR-AFA, was destroyed in an accident in Santos, Brazil. None of the seven occupants survived the accident. One of the victims was Eduardo Campos, the Brazilian Socialist Party's candidate for president.The airplane took off from Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport at 0921 hours local time and was bound for Guarujá. The only instrument approach available for Guarujá Airport is the NDB approach for runway 35. For aircraft with Approach Category B, like the Citation Excel, the minimum visibility is 2400 m. The visibility at the time of the accident, according to the automated weather report, was 3000 m in rain and mist. The crew thus contacted Guarujá Radio and requested an IFR ECHO 1 runway 35 NDB approach.The accident occurred when the airplane was approaching the airport. It came down in a residential area, about 4,3 km south west of the Guarujá Airport.Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese)- Application of controls - undetermined.Considering the elevated trajectory angle in relation to the terrain and the calculated speed (which far exceeded the operational limit of the aircraft), in the moments before the impact, it could be inferred that, from the moment the aircraft disappeared in the clouds, it could only have acquired such speed and trajectory if it had risen considerably to the point of even being detected by RADAR. Such conditions presented by the aircraft may have been the result of exaggerated control applications.- Attitude- contributed.The realization of the approach in an approach profile different from the one foreseen demonstrates a lack of adherence to the procedures, which allowed the beginning of the sequence of events that culminated in a missed approach, which was possibly influenced by the level of confidence that the pilot had in his operational capacity, from his previous experiences.- Characteristics of the task - undetermined.Although there was no pressure from passengers to enforce schedules, it is known that the routine of this activity creates an often unconscious self-pressure for the completion of flight schedules, in line with the commitments made by this type of flight demands performance requirements from pilots, which can influence them to operate at reduced safety margins. - Adverse weather conditions - contributed. The meteorological conditions were close to the safety minima for the approach and below the minimums to circle, foreseen in the ECHO 1 procedure. However, these conditions alone did not entail any risk to the operation if the ECHO 1 was followed in accordance with the parameters defined in the aeronautical publications and in accordance with the flight parameters defined by the aircraft manufacturer. When the parameters mentioned above were not followed, it was observed that the meteorological conditions were a complicating factor for the aircraft piloting, which made it difficult to stabilize the final approach, resulting in a rush.- Disorientation - contributed.In the scenario where the aircraft collided with the ground, there were several conditions that were favorable to a spatial disorientation such as reduced visibility due to weather conditions, stress and increased workload due to the rush, maneuvers with a load above 1.15G, lack of adequate training and a possible loss of situational awareness. The high negative pitch, the high speed, and the power developed by the engines at the moment of impact are also evidences compatible with the disorientation of the incapacitating type, and point to the contribution of this factor.- Team dynamics - undetermined.The integration between the pilots may have been hampered by the low experience as crew and also by the different training they had. In addition, the commander's characteristics, which indicated a more confident and imposing posture, as opposed to the more passive feature of the co-pilot could also have hampered the crew's dynamics in managing the flight.- Fatigue - undetermined.In the seven days prior to the accident, the crew was in compliance with the provisions of Law No. 7,183 of April 5, 1984 regarding the working day and rest time between days. However, the results obtained in the analysis of voice, speech and copilot language parameters indicated compatibility with fatigue and somnolence, which may have contributed to the degradation of crew performance.- Training, Training and Training - undetermined.The lack of crash training on the CE 560XLS + aircraft may have required greater cognitive effort for the seizure of the conditions required by the equipment, as there were possibly no conditioned behaviors for flight control that could provide greater agility of actions in the cabin. Thus, they probably did not possess the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that would enable them to adequately perform their activities in that operational context.- Phraseology of the ATS Body - undetermined.In spite of having reported, in the first contact, that the aerodrome operated under instrument flight conditions, the messages transmitted to the aircraft by Rádio Santos did not present the conditions of ceiling, visibility and SIGMET, as foreseen in ICA 100-37. This may have contributed to a reduction in the level of situational awareness of the crew, since the last information accessed was probably the METAR of 1100 am (UTC), which indicated conditions for visual operation of the aerodrome. In this way, pilots may have built a mental model on the weather conditions of SBST, in which they would be more favorable to the operation.- Flight Discipline - contributed.After coordinating its descent, PR-AFA made a left turn and, for no known reason, deviated from the W6 airway profile, descending below FL060. It then reported different positions from the actual ones until the moment it started a final approach. This approach differed from the trajectory of the final approach defined for the ECHO 1 procedure profile and was performed with different speed parameters than those recommended by the aircraft manufacturer. Such conditions have reduced the chances that the aircraft will fit into a stabilized final. The fact that the aircraft has overflown the runway followed by a curve at low altitude, with the weather conditions being below the minimum of the ""go around"" procedure; Instead of performing the rush profile provided for in the ECHO 1 procedure, also entailed risks to the operation and created favorable conditions for spatial disorientation.- Memory - undetermined.As the commander had already done visual approaches by the FMS on other occasions, the acquired working memory may have reinforced the safety in repeating it, even in another context, by the tendency of the human being to rely on previous successful experiences .- Perception - undetermined.An inaccurate perception of the pilots on the actual meteorological conditions that allowed the approach could have compromised the level of situational awareness and thus led the aircraft to an operating condition below the safety minima.- Flight planning - undetermined.The meteorological forecasts in the form of the TAF / GAMET code, valid at 12.00 (UTC) and available to the crew at the time the flight plan was passed in AIS-RJ, registered a possibility of degradation of visibility parameters and ceiling, due to the rain forecast associated with the humid mist, whose coverage included the duration of said flight, notably over the SBST area. The satellite image of 1100 AM UTC and the SIGMET, valid from 1030 AM (UTC), also showed a cold front in the Southeast region with a stratiform cloudiness band on SBST and prediction of convective nuclei with displacement To the northeast and with an average speed of 12kt. Despite the availability of such information, the crew may not have made a more accurate analysis showing a rapid degradation of the weather in the period between the take-off of SBRJ and the approach in SBST and thus may not have planned the flight in accordance with the conditions laid down by the meteorological service.- Organizational processes - undetermined.Despite having the C560 rating, required to operate the CE 560XLS + aircraft, none of the pilots were checked by contractors for their previous experience with this equipment and, as a result, no transition training and / or to operate the PR-AFA. The adoption of a formal system for the recruitment, selection, monitoring and evaluation of the professionals' performance could have identified the training needs for that type of aircraft.- Support systems - undetermined.Although the RBAC 61 required pilots to carry out flight instruction and proficiency testing to transition between CE 560XL family models, the need for specific training was only clarified in 04JUL2014, through the publication of the Supplementary Instruction of ANAC ( IS 61-004 Revision A). Until that date, such a need could only have been identified through consultation with the FAA FSB Report available only on the FAA website. In this context, PR-AFA pilots would only be subject to an assessment in EC 560XLS + on the occasion of their type revalidations, which would occur on the eve of their C560 qualifications, valid until October 2014 (commander ) And May 2015 (co-pilot). The fact that there was an authorization (C560) that was common to the operation of the C560 Citation, C560 Encore, C560 Encore +, CE 560XL, CE 560XLS or CE 560XLS + aircraft, did not allow the DCERTA system to refuse the pilot flight plan who did not have the proper training to operate one of those equipment. RBAC 67 contained physical and mental health requirements that were unclear, inducing physicians to use other publications to guide and subsidize their opinions and judgments about civil aviation personnel. The absence of such requirements, which should be adopted as acceptable minima for the pursuit of aerial activity, entailed the discretion of the physicians responsible for the judgments of the health inspections of the assessed personnel, and thus opened gaps that could allow non-fully qualified persons to perform functions In safety conditions below acceptable minimums.- Task overload - undetermined.Considering the possibility that the commander may have accumulated tasks as a consequence of a possible difficulty of the co-pilot to advise him at the beginning of the missed approach procedure, such accumulation may have exceeded his ability to manage them and thus have led to errors of piloting and / or spatial disorientation.13-08-2014",Executive,CENIPA ,2014

The captain was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the co-pilot was the Pilot Monitoring (PM).The departure, cruise and approach to Doncaster Sheffield Airport were uneventful. Although runway 02 was the active runway, the crew requested radar vectors for a visual final approach to runway 20, a request which was approved by ATC. The loadsheet recorded that the aircrafts mass at landing was expected to be 5,059 kg which required a target threshold indicated airspeed (IAS) of 101 kt.The aircraft touched down at 1936 hrs with an IAS of 102 kt and a peak normal acceleration of 1.3 g, and the commander moved the power levers aft to ground idle followed by reverse. As the aircraft decelerated, the commander moved the power levers forward to ground idle and asked the co-pilot to move the rpm levers to taxi. At an IAS of 65 kt, eight seconds after touchdown, the left wing dropped suddenly, the aircraft began to yaw to the left and the commander was unable to maintain directional control with either the rudder or the nosewheel steering tiller. The aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and stopped on the grass having turned through approximately 90°. The left landing gear had collapsed and the aircraft had come to a halt resting on its belly, right landing gear and left wing.The captain pulled both feather levers, to ensure that both engines were shut down, and switched the electrics master switch to emergency off. The co-pilot radioed for emergency services. A review of the previous 82 landings recorded on the FDR has not identified any of concern but it was noted that a peak normal acceleration of 1.72g was recorded during the eighteenth landing prior to the accident. However, this was within the landing gear limit load.Preliminary findings indicate that the failure was initiated as a result of stress corrosion cracking in the forward yoke pintle at the top of the left landing gear leg. Incidently, this same aircraft (Jetstream 31 msn 785) suffered a failure of the right hand main landing gear while landing at Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM), March 8, 2012. It was determined that in that case the landing gear had failed as a result of intergranular corrosion / stress corrosion cracking of the forward yoke pintle.ConclusionThe aircrafts left main landing gear failed as a result of stress corrosion cracking in the forward pintle housing, at the top of the left landing gear cylinder. The landing gear material is known to be susceptible to stress corrosion cracking. The investigation determined that a design solution implemented by the aircraft manufacturer following the 2012 accident, which was intended to prevent stress corrosion cracking, had not met its original design intent.15-08-201415-08-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2014

The aircraft was piloted by the former owner of the now defunct airline LAPA.The aircraft departed Estancia La Nueva Airstrip about 1434 LT on a 40-minute IFR flight to Buenos Aires-Jorge Newbery Airport.At 1445, at the request of the pilot, the aircraft was authorized direct to the VANAR point, which is on the approach path for runway 13 of Jorge Newbery Airport.The aircraft crossed the extended centreline of the approach path almost perpendicular, 6.4 NM northwest of VANAR.The pilot was authorized to intercept the instrument landing system (ILS) locator of runway 13 and to descend to 2500 ft. At 1510 LV-WLT started a right turn with a ground speed of 260 kt, stopping the turn with a 204° course. This course implied that the aircraft would intercept the locator axis with an angle greater than 70°. In this position, the indicated airspeed / IAS of the aircraft should have been set at 200 kt IAS or lower to allow flap extension for approach, in accordance with the information in the BE 300 flight manual.Due to the magnitude of the intercept angle and the velocity above that established for the flight condition, LV-WLT exceeded the locator axis. The aircraft then started a turn to the left setting a course to intercept the locator at an angle of approximately 90°, and a ground speed observed on the radar of 228 kt. The combination of the magnitude of the interception angle and velocity, meant that the locator axis was exceeded again. The Newbery Tower controller warned the pilot and offered help to bring him closer to the approach path. The pilot replied ""... we are intercepting"", starting a turn to the right.Nineteen seconds later the aircraft struck three homes in the La Isla neighborhood of the Nordelta complex, Tigre, province of Buenos Aires, with an approximate course of 155°, disintegrating on impact and catching fire.The impact on a street occurred with an angle of its horizontal axis of approximately 45° and with a lateral slope to the right of approximately 60°. After the initial impact and as a consequence of its kinetic energy, the aircraft rebounded and impacted a house.The accident resulted from a combination of immediate triggers and failures in the aeronautical system's defenses, including- Prevailing weather conditions at the scene of the accident;- Pilot-in-command experienced difficulties in managing aircraft control and flight path during an instrument approach;- The probability of overload of work of the pilot in command as a result of the operational demands presented by the situation;- The execution of the operation by a single pilot (single-pilot operation), taking into account the age of the pilot; and- Deficiencies in pilot-in-command certification denying the value of CE-6 as a defense barrier for the aeronautical system.

Before the flight, notices to airmen (NOTAMs) had been issued, which stated that the runway 14 threshold had been displaced 3,377 ft and that the instrument landing system and RNAV instrument approaches were not available. Although the NOTAMs were included in the flight release paperwork, dispatch personnel overlooked them, which resulted in flight planning numbers predicated on the full length of runway 14.During the approach, the pilots listened to the automatic terminal information service information and then became aware that runway 14 was shortened due to construction.Subsequently, the pilots calculated the landing distance required to land on a wet runway and chose to land on runway 1, which was the longer runway. The PIC reported that, during the approach, they encountered light rain but that the rain was moving away from the airport, which alleviated any concern regarding standing water on the runway.LandingThe SIC flew a stabilized approach 9 knots above the reference speed (Vref) and that the airplane touched down 903 ft from the runway threshold at a groundspeed of 118 knots. The SIC stated that he began braking with half pressure and continued to increase the brake pressure to maximum, which was the normal braking procedure, but that the airplane did not appear to be decelerating. The PIC informed the SIC that they needed to slow down, and the SIC replied that he had ""no braking."" The SIC then applied the emergency parking brake (EPB), but the airplane still did not slow down. FDR data indicated that the airplane achieved its maximum deceleration during the landing roll before the application of the EPB. FDR data showed that, once the SIC applied the EPB, the wheel speed dropped to 0. After determining that there was insufficient runway remaining for a go-around, the pilots realized that the airplane was going to exit the end of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane began to skid along the runway, which resulted in reverted-rubber hydroplaning, thus decreasing the stopping performance, and then exited the departure end of the runway and continued about 400 ft in soft terrain before it impacted a ditch and came to a stop.An examination of the brake system and data downloaded from the brake control unit indicated that the brake system functioned as commanded during the landing. Analysis of the runway surface and the amount of precipitation showed that there should have been no standing water on the runway. Landing distance calculations performed in accordance with the aircraft flight manual (AFM) showed that, even though the SIC exceeded Vref, the airplane should have been able to stop on the available runway. Braking friction According to the National Transportation Safety Board's airplane performance study, the maximum wheel braking friction coefficient achieved during the portion of the ground roll before the application of the EPB was significantly less than the maximum wheel braking coefficient that would have been expected given the unfactored wet-runway landing distances published in the AFM. However, the study determined that, if the EPB had not been engaged and airplane had maintained the braking friction level attained during the landing roll before the engagement of the EPB, it would have been able to stop on the available runway. Therefore, the SIC's application of the EPB, which locked the wheels, reduced the friction level, and decreased the braking performance, prevented the airplane from stopping on the available runway.Nonetheless, the braking friction deficit observed in this accident showed that the stopping performance of the airplane was more consistent with AFM landing distances for runways contaminated with standing water than for runways that were merely ""wet"" even though it was determined that the runway could not have been flooded.Since the accident, the operator has issued a flight operations bulletin instructing pilots to conduct a landing distance assessment using the AFM contaminated runway performance data for the lowest contamination depth when the following three conditions exist 1) the runway did not have a treated surface, 2) thrust reversers were deferred or not installed, and 3) the airport was reporting rain or heavy rain.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The second-in-command's (SIC) engagement of the emergency parking brake (EPB), which decreased the airplane's braking performance and prevented it from stopping on the available runway. Contributing to the SIC's decision to engage the EPB was the lower-than-anticipated deceleration due to a wet-runway friction level that was far lower than the levels used to determine the wet-runway stopping distances in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) and necessitated a landing distance considerably greater than that published in the AFM.""19-09-201419-09-201419-09-201419-09-2014",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2014

Both pilots and two passengers sustained fatal injuries.The aircraft was operated by Hevilift and conducted a charter flight from Woitape to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. It took off at 0916 local time with the First Officer acting as Pilot Flying and the captain as Pilot Monitoring.At 0922, when approximately 67 km from Port Moresby at 8,000 ft, Flight Service cleared the aircraft to enter controlled airspace VFR and instructed the flight crew to contact Jacksons Radar at 56 km (30 DME).At 0925, the Pilot Monitoring called Jacksons Radar and reported that at 54 km (29 DME) from Port Moresby on the 177 radial at 8,000 ft. He stated that they were visual, and requested a clearance to descend. The radar controller cleared the flight to descend to 6,000 ft visual and to track to a left base position for runway 14 right. The Pilot in Command acknowledged this. The radar controller then instructed the crew to contact Jacksons Tower at 19 km (10 DME). At 0937, the Pilot Monitoring called the tower controller and reported at 17.5 km (9.5 DME) from Jacksons Airport, descending below 4,000 ft AMSL, and stated ""were running into a bit of cloud, we might as well pick up the ILS if its OK"". The tower controller replied immediately, but did not respond to the mention of the ILS; instead, she said ""kilo sierra foxtrot roger, continue approach runway 14 right, report on [..] left base"". The Pilot Monitoring responded by reading this back without further mention of the ILS. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft impacted terrain at approximately 1,600 ft AMSL on the northern side of Mount Lawes, just below the summit. Initial review of the cockpit voice recording indicated that there were no aural warnings from the enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) and that the flight crew did not see the terrain until approximately one second before impact.Causes [Contributing factors]a) The flight crew continued the descent in instrument meteorological conditions without confirming their position.b) The flight crews assessment of their position was incorrect and they had lost situational awarenessc) The flight crew deprived themselves of the ""Caution"" and ""Warning"" alerts that would have sounded about 20 sec and about 10 sec respectively before the collision, by not deactivating the EGPWS Terrain Inhibit prior to departure from Woitape.20-09-201420-09-201420-09-201420-09-201420-09-201416 February 1977YV-31Cde Havilland Canada28 May 1977YV-31CLAV-Línea Aeropostal VenezolanaJanuary 1988YV-531CLínea Turística Aereotuy10 December 1993N528SAScott Aircraft Sales Inc.11 February 1994P2-HCFHeviliftMarch 2005P2-KSFHevilift",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2014

While on approach to Timmins, the crew selected landing gear down, but did not get an indication in the handle that the landing gear was down and locked. A fly-by at the airport provided visual confirmation that the landing gear was not fully extended. The crew followed the Quick Reference Handbook procedures and selected the alternate landing-gear extension system, but they were unable to lower the landing gear manually. An emergency was declared, and the aircraft landed with only the nose gear partially extended. The aircraft came to rest beyond the end of Runway 28. All occupants evacuated the aircraft through the main entrance door. No fire occurred, and there were no injuries to the occupants. Emergency services were on scene for the evacuation.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. During the extension of the landing gear, a wire bundle became entangled around the landing-gear rotating torque shaft, preventing full extension of the landing gear.2.

No one was injured in the accident. The flight departed at 1437 under visual flight rules (VFR). The captain conducted the takeoff and, shortly after the aircraft became airborne, handed over the control to the FO. For the remainder of the flight, the FO was the pilot flying (PF), and the captain was the pilot not flying (PNF). At about 1510, the FO conducted an approach briefing.Ninety seconds later, the FO called for the initial landing checks to be completed and, 10 seconds after that, for the final landing checks to be completed. The flaps were at 20°, and the aircraft was configured for landing.At 151217, at an altitude of approximately 200 feet above ground level (agl), the captain asked the FO a non-operational question. About 10 seconds later, the radar altimeter annunciated 10 feet.At 151232, after floating for 6.3 seconds, the aircraft touched down about 750 feet from the threshold of runway 23, which is 1649 feet long. On touchdown, the captain took control of the aircraft, immediately selected reverse thrust, and applied the brakes. The captain determined that the aircraft could not be stopped before the end of the runway and initiated an aggressive left turn onto the taxiway.During the turn, a tire hit a runway edge light, and the right propeller struck a runway identification sign before the aircraft came to a stop. Debris from the sign penetrated the fuselage just aft of the right cockpit door. As the aircraft was skidding, it came within 3 feet of sliding off the taxiway surface and going down a significant drop.The crew shut down the aircraft and exited at the same time as the passengers.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The aircraft floated for 6.3 seconds over the runway and touched down about 750 feet from the threshold, which reduced the length of runway available for stopping.2. The captain took control almost halfway down the runway with insufficient runway remaining in which to stop, requiring an aggressive left turn onto the taxiway that resulted in significant damage to the aircraft.Findings as to risk1. If pilots are not prepared to conduct a go-around on every approach, there is a risk that they will not be ready to react to a situation that requires a go-around.2. If performance charts are not consulted, there is a risk that the required landing distance will be greater than the actual length of the runway.3. If flight crews do not adhere to sterile flight deck procedures, they may be distracted during critical phases of flight, which could jeopardize the safety of flight.4. If crew resource management training is not a regulatory requirement, it is less likely to be introduced by operators, and as a result their crew coordination may be less effective.5. If crew resource management training is not provided, pilots may be unprepared to respond to situations that may jeopardize the safety of flight.6. If pilots do not focus on the task at hand, there is a risk that they will not react to conditions that could affect the safety of flight.7. If organizations do not use modern safety management practices, there is an increased risk that hazards will not be identified and mitigated.8. If flight data recordings are not available to an investigation, the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety may be precluded.Other findings1. The crew used 20° flaps for landing, which did not permit them to meet the calculated landing distance requirement of the Aircraft Flight Manual and the 10% factor required by regulation for landings on unprepared surfaces.3 June 1976N72348de Havilland Canada14 June 1976N72348Ross Aviation7 July 1997N148DERoss Aviation22 October 2010N148DEGravitas Aviation13 April 2011C-GKSNRocky Mountain Aircraft20 July 2011C-GKSNAir Labrador30 April 2013C-GKSNAir Labrador28 September 2014C-GKSNAir LabradorMarch 2015C-GKSNAir Labrador31 August 2017C-GKSNRocky Mountain Aircraft11 October 20178Q-TAHTrans Maldivian Airways8 September 2020C-GKSNRocky Mountain Aircraft21 February 2021PK-OTWRimbun Air15 September 2021PK-OTWRimbun Air",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2014

According to the crew nothing of note occurred during the take-off, climb or cruise flight.According to the captain, approach and landing at Schiphol Airport were prepared prior to top of descent. At that time the current weather at Schiphol Airport had been received via ATIS. The weather indicated the need to perform an ILS CAT I approach.The captain stated that the airplane was prepared for an ILS CAT I approach followed by an automatic landing. This procedure is seldom flown in operational practice and was therefore comprehensively discussed by the two pilots prior to the descent. Both pilots stated that this briefing was clear and that there was no need to consult the manuals. The first officer stated that during the briefing it was emphasised that this would be the first ILS CAT I approach followed by an automatic landing in limited visibility conditions for both pilots since completing conversion training on the Embraer 190.While descending through FL160, the flight crew began programming the FMS in preparation for an approach and landing on runway 36R.Having contacted the Schiphol Approach controller, the pilot flying flew the airplane to final approach based on radar vectors. The autopilot was set to follow the final approach path and the speed was controlled by autothrottle. While the airplane was flying on the final approach course and upon intercepting the glide slope, the landing gear was lowered and flaps were set to position 3. At 1400 feet, the flaps were set to the FULL position. At 1100 feet, speed was reduced to the calculated approach speed of 124 knots. At 1000 feet the airplane was prepared for landing on runway 36R.The crew stated that no incorrect or abnormal indications about the aeroplane's configuration were observed during the final approach. The crew assumed that the airplane was correctly configured for the intended automatic landing.The captain stated that he saw the runway from a distance of approximately 4 NM (7.4 kilometres). At that time the airplane was flying at an altitude of approximately 1200 feet. The first officer, in turn, stated that he could see the runway before the aircraft had passed an altitude of more than 500 feet. At that time the airplane was flying slightly to the left of the final approach path. Soon after, this was corrected by the autopilot. At low altitude, the first officer again noticed a slight leftward displacement.The captain stated that at approximately 50 feet above the runway he noticed that the airplane was continuing to fly towards the runway at a constant rate of descent and did not perform a flare. The aeroplane's pitch remained at a constant 1.6 degrees above the horizon.In an attempt to reduce the aeroplane's rate of descent the captain pulled back on the control column at a low altitude. The autopilot disengaged at a height less than 9 feet (3 metres) above the runway. The tractive force on the control column at that moment was twice as high as during a normal manual landing. The airplane made a hard landing. After the main landing gear touched the ground the aeroplane's pitch increased further to 8.6 degrees before the nose wheel was landed. The first officer stated that he was concerned that the airplane had sustained damage as a result of how hard the landing was. Therefore, while rolling-out on the runway he asked the captain if he could still steer the aeroplane; the Captain replied in the affirmative. After the landing the Captain informed the passengers and taxied to the aircraft stand.After the flight arrived at the aircraft stand and the engines were shut down, the central maintenance computer on board the Embraer 190 printed a warning that the airplane had touched down with a vertical acceleration that was 2.78 g. Engineering personnel were informed about the hard landing so that the airplane could be inspected.The inspection by engineering personnel revealed that the airplane had been damaged. An operating rod of the left-hand main landing gear door was damaged and an operating rod of the innermost right-hand wing flap was bent.CONCLUSIONSThe crew were incorrectly under the impression that they had configured the aircraft for an automatic landing. The indications of the automatic pilot did not lead the pilots to suspect that the aircraft was actually configured for a manual landing. The FMA indications that they saw during the approach were what they were used to seeing. Moreover, the aircraft was in a valid configuration, which meant no error messages were generated. As a result, both pilots had no reason to think that the aircraft was not flying in the correct mode for an ILS Category I approach followed by an automatic landing. The aircraft did not perform a landing flare and made a hard landing.The fact that the Cockpit Voice Recorder was no longer available has had adverse effects on reconstructing events and gaining insight into the crew's considerations prior to the hard landing. The crew's recollections of the incident have faded and/or may have been influenced by more recent flight experiences. The procedures for reporting incidents described in the airline's operations manual leave room for interpretation regarding which incidents should be reported and what follow-up actions are required. This results in the loss of important sources of information for the investigation of incidents.",International Scheduled Passenger,Dutch Safety Board ,2014

The flight continued to its destination and was towed to a hanger. Upon further examination it was found that a stack of cargo ""cookie sheets"" came free of their cargo locks in position 9 and shifted rearward. There were no injuries to the two flight pilots and one onboard mechanic. Aloha Air Cargo was chartered by Hawaii Island Air to fly round trip from Honolulu (HNL) to LNY to deliver lumber for an impeding hurricane. LNY was not a station Aloha Air Cargo normally flew to, nor did they have employees there. In addition to the flight crew, a flight mechanic and a load planner were scheduled to fly with the aircraft to provide support. Just prior to the flight's departure, dispatch noted that due to weight and balance concerns on the return trip only one of the additional employees could ride with the aircraft. The choice was made to leave the load planner behind and take the aircraft mechanic as the Additional Crew Member (ACM). This was contrary to company guidance.Flight 600, departed HNL at 1240 local time and arrived in LNY at 1253. After arriving in LNY, the aircraft was off loaded and then the, now empty, cargo pallet cookie sheets were loaded for the return flight. The mechanic, first officer (FO), and Island Air employees helped to load the aircraft and verified that the locks were up and locked in all positions. There were a total of 8 empty pallet cookie sheets. Of these sheets 7 were strapped down and secured to the 8th sheet. The 8th sheet was then locked down in position 9 (the aircraft was equipped with 9 cargo positions on the main deck with the ninth position being the most aft and turned lengthwise). This was done per dispatch's request for center of gravity (CG) consideration, even though before departure from HNL the load planner had discussed with the mechanic that each pallet should go back in their original position and locked down.Flight 601, departed LNY at 1449 and arrived in HNL at 1514. Nothing out of the ordinary was noticed by the crew in the feel of the aircraft nor did they hear anything unusual.The auto fail light came on during climb and the quick reference handbook (QRH) was then followed. No door lights illuminated and the outflow valve indicated ""Closed."" However, upon reaching 10,000 ft. the altitude alert horn came on so the crew leveled at 10,000 ft. No emergency was declared. The aircraft landed uneventfully. A post-flight check revealed that all of the pallets were loaded into position 9, that none of the locks between position 8 and 9 were up, and the straps holding the sheets had allowed the sheets to shift aft making contact with the aft pressure bulkhead. The bulkhead had substantial damage.Probable Cause the improper loading and securing of the cargo pallets, which shifted on departure, resulting in substantial damage to the aft pressure bulkhead.16-10-2014",Cargo,NTSB ,2014

The three crew members and the passenger, CEO of oil company Total, Christophe de Margerie, were killed.At the time of the accident snow removal vehicles were active at the airport. Two snowplows were working under the command of a supervisor who was present in a car in the area. The supervisor lost sight of one of the snowplows. The driver of this vehicle lost situational awareness and entered the intersection of runways 06/24 and 01/19. At the same time, the Falcon 50 was cleared for takeoff on runway 06. The crew taxied onto the runway from taxiway A11 and began the takeoff roll. About 10 seconds after the crew had received permission to take off, the surface movement radar in the control tower showed one of the snowplows to be moving along the left border of runway 19 in a southerly direction towards the intersection with runway 06. After about 14 seconds the aircraft commenced the takeoff and the crew observed a ""car"" crossing the runway. Takeoff was continued. The airplane lifted off the runway at a speed of about 134 knots. After 1030 meters the right wing and right hand main landing gear impacted the snowplow. The airplane rolled inverted and came down 250 meters further on. A post impact fire broke out.CONCLUSIONThe accident involving Falcon 50EX F-GLSA aircraft occurred at nighttime under foggy conditions while it was taking off after cleared by the controller due to collision with the snowplow that executed runway incursion and stopped on the runway.Most probably, the accident was caused by the combination of the following contributing factors- lack of guidance on loss of control over an airdrome vehicle and/or situational awareness on the airfield in pertinent documents defining the duties of airdrome service personnel (airdrome shift supervisor and vehicle drivers);- insufficient efficiency of risk mitigation measures to prevent runway incursions in terms of airdrome peculiarilies that is two intersecling runways;- lack of proper supervision from the airdrome service shift supervisor, alcohol detected in his organism, over the airfield operations no report to the ATM or request to the snowplow driver as he lost visual contact with the snowplow;- violation by the airdrome service shift supervisor of the procedure for airdrome vehicles operations, their entering the runway (RWY 2) out of operation (closed for takeoff and landing operations) without requesting and receiving clearance from the ground controller;- violations by the medical personnel of Vnukovo AP of vehicle driver medical check requirements by performing formally (only exterior assessment) the mandatory medical check of drivers after the duty, which significantly increased the risk of drivers consuning alcohol during the duty. The measures and controls applied at Vnukovo Airport to mitigate the risk of airdrome drivers doing their duties under the influence of alcohol were not effective enough;- no possibility for the snowplow drivers engaged in airfield operations (due to lack of pertinent equipment on the airdrome vehicles) to continuously listen to the radio exchange at the Departure Control frequency, which does not comply with the Interaction Procedure of the Airdrome Service with Vnukovo ATC Center.- loss of situational awareness by the snowplow driver, alcohol detected in his organism, while perfonning airfield operations that led to runway incursion and stop on the runway in use.His failure to contact the airdrome service shift supervisor or ATC controllers after situational awareness was lost;- ineffective procedures that resulted in insufficiently trained personnel using the airfield surveillance and control subsystem A3000 of A-SMGCS at the Vnukovo ATC Center, for air traffic management;- no recommendation in the SOP of ATM personnel of Vnukovo ATC Center on how to set up the airfield surveillance and control subsystem A3000, including activation and deactivation of the Reserved Lines and alerts (as a result, all alerts were de-activated at the departure controller and ground controller's working positions) as well as how to operate the system including attention allocation techniques during aircraft takeoff and actions to deal with the subsystem messages and alerts;- the porting of the screen second input of the A3000 A-SMGCS at the ATC shift supervisor WP for the display of the weather information that is not envisaged by the operational manual of the airfield surveillance and control subsystem. When weather information is selected to be displayed the radar data and the light alerts (which were present during the accident takeoff) become un available for the specialist that occupies the ATC shift supervisor's working position;- the ATC shift supervisor's decision to join the sectors at working positions of Ground and Departure Control without considering the actual level of personnel training and possibilities for them to use the information of the airfield surveillance and control system (the criteria for joining of sectors are not defined in the Job Description of ATC shift supervisor, in particular it does not take into account the technical impossibility to change settings of the airfield surveillance and control system);- failure by the ground controller to comply with the SOPs, by not taking actions to prevent the incursion of RWY 2 that was closed for takeoff and landing operations by the vehicles though having radar information and alert on the screen of the airfield surveillance and control system;- failure by the out of staff instructor controller and trainee controller (providing ATM under the supervision of the instructor controller) to detect two runway incursions by the snowplow on the runway in use, including after the aircrew had been cleared to take off (as the clearance was given, the runway was clear), provided there was pertinent radar information on the screen of the airfield surveillance and control subsystem and as a result failure to inform the crew about the obstacle on the runway;- lack of recommendations at the time of the accident in the Operator's (Unijet) FOM for flight crews on actions when external threats appear (e.g. foreign objects on the runway) during the takeoff;- the crew failing to take measures to reject takeoff as soon as the Captain mentioned ""the car crossing the road"". No decision to abort takeoff might have been caused by probable nonoptimal psycho-emotional status of the crew (the long wait for the departure at an unfamiliar airport and their desire to fly home as soon as possible), which might have made it difficult for them to assess the actual threat level as they noticed the snowplow after they had started the takeoff run;- the design peculiarity of the Falcon 50EX aircraft (the nose wheel steering can only be controlled from the LH seat) resulting in necessity to transfer aircraft control at a high workload phase of the takeoff roll when the FO (seated right) performs the takeoff20-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-201420-10-2014",Executive,MAK ,2014

Flap retraction and its associated acceleration combined to set in motion a somatogravic illusion for the PF. The PF's reaction to pitch down while initiating a turn led to an extreme unusual attitude and the subsequent crash. PM awareness to the imminent loss of control and any attempt to intervene could not be determined. Crew resource management (CRM) performance was insufficient to avoid the crash.

Once the landing gear was retracted and the aircraft was established in the climb, the flight crew discussed the vibration. The cabin crew informed the pilots that a tire had blown.Company maintenance and operations crews at its dispatch centre were contacted. Because of strong crosswinds, returning to Calgary was not an option, and a decision was made to land at Edmonton International Airport and to switch aircraft owing to the ruptured tire. Maintenance personnel recommended that a hard landing be avoided.Air traffic control arranged for the aircraft to level at 13000 feet above sea level. The cabin crew confirmed that the number 3 tire had blown and revealed that something had struck the aft fuselage.Throughout the approach phase of the landing sequence, the landing gear control panel indicated that the landing gear was down and locked. The aircraft touched down very lightly on runway 02 at Edmonton. As the wheels spun up, a pronounced vibration shook the aircraft 2.4 seconds after initial touchdown; while the nose wheel of the aircraft was still airborne, the right main landing gear collapsed. The right-side propeller blades struck the runway, and all were sheared on contact. One large section of a propeller blade penetrated the aircraft cabin next to passenger row 7. At the same time as the propeller contact, the nose landing gear came down hard and its tires ruptured. The aircraft slid slightly to the right and came to a stop off the right edge of the runway, approximately 3200 feet past the touchdown point.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The number 3 tire ruptured on takeoff, most likely as a result of impact with a hard object.2. During landing, the failed number 3 tire was spun by contact with the ground and was maintained at a rotational speed that was the same as or very close to one of the natural frequencies of the main landing gear. This caused the lock links to trigger the proximity sensor electronic unit to de-energize the solenoid sequence valve, thereby relieving system pressure from the extend port of the unlock actuator.3. The excessive vibration caused the lock links to overcome the force from the downlock springs and unlock the stabilizer brace as a result of gear dynamics, which led to collapse of the right main landing gear.06-11-201406-11-201406-11-201406-11-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2014

No issues were noted.For the flight back to Delhi, the pilot requested a runway 04 departure. The aircraft was given taxi clearance via taxiway A. The visibility reported at the time of departure was 6 km with calm winds. Temperature and dew point were 29°C and 15°C respectively. After entering the runway, aircraft backtracked, lined up on runway 04 and reported ready for take-off at 1335 UTC. Immediately the aircraft was cleared for take-off. During take-off roll at a speed of about 78 knots, the pilot saw something moving towards the aircraft in his peripheral vision. It was otherwise pitch dark and nothing was visible beyond the nose lighting of the aircraft.Thereafter the flight crew heard a bang and it felt as if the aircraft had gone over a bump. The pilot immediately called for a rejected takeoff. The flight crew reported that they had hit a dog on the runway and that they were returning to the apron.During a subsequent walk around inspection the pilot in command observed that the engine cowl was badly damaged and there were holes on the sides of engine. It was decided to disembark all passengers. The fire station in the mean time called ATC to confirm whether there was a problem with SpiceJet aircraft and asked for permission to enter runway. ATC instructed fire personnel not to enter runway. ATC stated that all operations were normal and that the aircraft had hit an animal.A CNS operational jeep then requested ATC to cross the runway, which was granted. The jeep driver then reported to the Tower controller that there were two buffalos on the runway. One was dead and the other was roaming on the runway. The runway was immediately closed for operations. After removal of the dead buffalo and inspection of the runway it was declared operational again.Probable cause of the accidentThe accident was caused as the aircraft during its initial take-off roll hit an animal (buffalo) standing on the runway, resulting in damage to its engine.The animal entered the operational area and the runway because of several breaches in the boundary wall.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2014

The aircraft was destroyed and all nine occupants onboard were fatally injured. The airplane departed Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS) on an IFR flight plan for a 24-minute flight to Freeport.The aircraft made contact with Freeport ATC as required and was given the current weather conditions and cleared for the instrument ILS Z 06 Approach. The aircraft was unable to land on the first attempt, due to heavy rain showers and reduced visibility. The crew executed a missed approach procedure and continued outbound and entered the published holding pattern at 2,000 feet. Some time after entering the holding pattern, ATC reported the weather as improving and thus a second ILS Z 06 approach was requested by the crew and granted by ATC. During the return for the second instrument approach, ATC reported the weather as again deteriorating due to rain and haze. The crew deliberately continued descending below the published minimum altitude for this approach while attempting to find the runway visually. Repeated warnings about altitude and terrain proximity from the onboard Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) were ignored. One of the crew disabled the warning alert system and continued with the Before Landing Checks.The crew continued the descent while looking visually for the runway until the aircraft right wing struck the crane positioned at Dock #2 of the Grand Bahama Shipyard. The impact occurred with two support beams above the crane operator's cab approximately 115 feet mean sea level. After losing the outboard portion of the right wing and fuel tank, as a result of the impact, the aircraft continued its downward, uncontrolled descent, crashing inverted into a mound of garbage at the City Services Limited, a garbage and metal recycling plant which is located adjacent to the Grand Bahama Shipyard. The aircraft finally came to a stop after impact with a metal generator-housing unit located at the recycling plant.An ILS Z approach procedure is available for runway 6 at Freeport.

The flight was rescheduled for 20 November 2014 at 0600. Its early-morning departure was intended to enable the regularly scheduled return flight to depart Fort Simpson at 0800 with minimal delay. The pilot reported for duty at 0500 to prepare for the flight. A pre-flight inspection was performed, wing covers were removed, and no contamination was observed on the wings. The pilot filed an IFR flight plan and checked for enroute icing condition reports. There were no reported airmens meteorological information (AIRMET) and pilot weather report (PIREP) for the flight-planned route. No other weather information was requested or offered.The airplane departed Yellowknife at approximately 0642, with an IFR clearance to 8000 feet above sea level. During the climb, the aircraft encountered cloud layers; at approximately 0651, flying through 6000 feet asl, it encountered icing conditions. The aircraft continued to climb and levelled off at 8000 feet asl, where cruise power was set. The airspeed did not accelerate beyond 120 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and the flight began to descend with cruise power set. At 0659, the pilot contacted the Edmonton, Alberta, Area Control Centre (ACC) and requested a lower altitude, as he was unable to maintain 120 KIAS. Edmonton ACC cleared the flight to 6000 feet asl direct to Fort Simpson. During the controlled descent, airspeed continued to decline below 120 KIAS, even with the application of maximum continuous power. At 0706, a request was made to Edmonton ACC to return to CYZF because of severe icing. Flight 223 was ultimately cleared to Yellowknife at 3000 feet asl. The pilot experienced periods of elevator buffeting and uncommanded forward pitch movements during the turn. He continued the descent in order to maintain 110 KIAS. Flap position remained fully up, as the pilot was concerned that movement would further affect tailplane effectiveness.At 0717, the pilot advised Yellowknife Tower that the aircraft was in severe icing conditions and unable to maintain altitude. It was cleared to 2100 feet asl (minimum vectoring altitude). At 0719, the pilot experienced a significant uncommanded pitch forward and advised ATC that they were unable to maintain 2100 feet asl; a Mayday was declared.At 0720, when the aircraft was 300 feet above ground level, the pilot experienced a series of wing drops and an associated rate of descent of 1200 feet per minute at 100 to 110 KIAS. In response, the power lever was pushed fully forward, exceeding the maximum continuous rating of 1865 foot-pounds of torque. No flap selections were made.While still in darkness, the aircraft contacted the frozen surface of Great Slave Lake at 0721, and continued moving for 2300 feet before it struck a rock outcropping with the nose and left main landing gear. The aircraft came to rest approximately 600 feet from the outcropping and 2900 feet from the initial touchdown point. There were no injuries to the occupants, but the aircraft was severely damaged. There was no post-impact fire.Passenger evacuation was ordered once the pilot had assessed the situation. Passengers attempted to open the main cabin door but were unable to do so. After several failed attempts to evacuate, the passengers succeeded in exiting via the left cockpit door with the aid of cockpit lighting.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Not using all enroute information led the pilot to underestimate the severity and duration of the icing conditions that would be encountered.2. Inadequate awareness of aircraft limitations in icing conditions and incomplete weight-and-balance calculations led to the aircraft being dispatched in an overweight state for the forecast icing conditions. The aircraft centre of gravity was not within limits, and this led to a condition that increased stall speed and reduced aircraft climb performance.3. The pilot's expectation that the flight was being undertaken at altitudes where it should have been possible to avoid icing or to move quickly to an altitude without icing conditions led to his decision to continue operation of the aircraft in icing conditions that exceeded the aircraft's performance capabilities.4. The severity of the icing conditions encountered and the duration of the exposure resulted in reductions in aerodynamic performance, making it impossible to prevent descent of the aircraft.5. The inability to arrest descent of the aircraft resulted in the forced landing on the surface of Great Slave Lake and the collision with terrain.6. The Type C pilot self-dispatch system employed by Air Tindi did not have quality assurance oversight or adequate support systems. This contributed to the aircraft being dispatched in conditions not suitable for safe flight.20-11-201420-11-201420-11-2014",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2014

At 0832 hrs G-LGNL was cleared to enter runway 18 at Stornoway Airport and take off, and the ATC controller transmitted that the surface wind was from 270° at 27 kt. The commander commented to the co-pilot that the wind was across the runway and that there was no tailwind. As the aircraft taxied onto the runway, the co-pilot applied almost full right aileron input consistent with a cross-wind from the right, and the commander said to the co-pilot ""charlie , one hundred, strong wind from the right"". The commander advanced the power levers, the co-pilot said ""autocoarsen high"" and the engine torques increased symmetrically. The commander instructed the co-pilot to ""set takeoff power"" to which the co-pilot replied ""apr armed"". Approximately one second after this call, the engine torques began to increase symmetrically, reaching 100% as the aircraft accelerated through 70 kt.During the early stages of the takeoff, left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained an approximately constant heading. As the aircraft continued accelerating, the rudder was centralised, after which there was a small heading change to the left, then to the right, then a rapid heading change to the left causing the aircraft to deviate to the left of the runway centreline.The pilot applied right rudder but although the aircraft changed heading to the right in response, it did not alter the aircrafts track significantly and the aircraft skidded to the left, departing the runway surface onto the grass at an IAS of 80 kt. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft crossed a disused runway and back onto grass. During this period the nose landing gear collapsed before the aircraft came to a halt approximately 38 m left of the edge of the runway and 250 m from where it first left the paved surface.After the aircraft came to a halt, the captain saw that the propellers were still turning and so called into the cabin for the passengers to remain seated. One of the passengers shouted for someone to open the emergency exit but the cabin crew member instructed the passengers not to do so because the propellers were still turning. The co-pilot observed that the right propeller was still turning so operated the engine fire extinguishers to shut down both engines. When the passenger seated in the emergency exit row on the right of the aircraft saw that the right propeller had stopped, he decided to open the exit. He climbed out onto the wing and helped the remaining passengers leave the aircraft through the same exit, instructing them to slide off the rear of the wing onto the ground. The left propeller was still turning at the time the right over-wing exit was opened and the passenger seated in the left-side emergency exit row decided not to open the left exit.The technique for controlling the direction of the aircraft on the runway is to use rudder assisted by nose wheel steering (NWS) at low speeds because the rudder has reduced effectiveness below 40 kt.When rudder is used, the requirement for NWS to assist directional control will reduce progressively as speed increases above 40 kt and rudder effectiveness increases. It is likely that no assistance will be required by 60 kt and, therefore, there will be no step-change in NWS directional effect when the pilot releases the steering control. During this attempted takeoff, rudder was approximately neutral from 40 kt, the point at which it would have become effective, and directional control was probably maintained through NWS alone (asymmetric thrust or differential braking having been discounted). If rudder had been applied, there would have been a reduced NWS requirement at any given speed and therefore there would have been a reduced likelihood of a change directional effect when the NWS control was released. The lack of data showing NWS commands meant that these considerations could not be verified.PROBABLE CAUSE The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.02-01-201502-01-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2015

The flight to Matthews Ridge was uneventful until the final approach to land. The aircraft approached the runway from the left and had to make a steep bank in an attempt to establish on the runway centerline. The aircraft was slow in the turn and was possibly further slowed by the steep bank causing the aircraft to exhibit the characteristics of an imminent accelerated stall. This forced the aircraft's rate of sink to increase and the pilot was unable to stabilize the aircraft's approach. The aircraft's port wing touched the ground first, followed bythe port undercarriage. There were no injuries or fatalities.CauseThe probable cause of the accident was that the aircraft was slow and close to the threshold on left base of RWY29. The pilot executed and maintained a steep left turn which resulted in theaircraft experiencing an incipient accelerated stall.Contributory Causes1. The approach to landing was not properly configured, which resulted in an unsafe and unstable approach.2. Although he felt the aircraft buffeting, the pilot did not recognize that there was an impending accelerated stall and did not react in a timely manner to correct it.3. The weather was not conducive to VFR operations.4. Given the prevailing weather conditions, the pilot should not have descended below the MSA of 3000ft.5.

Due to the approaching Tropical Storm Amang (Mekkhala) the Papal visit was cut short and all aircraft were prepared for departure.At 1304 hours, the Global 5000 was given start up clearance by tower controller and subsequently a taxi clearance at 1308 to exit via the south taxiway next to a departing Airbus A320 carrying the Papal entourage. Prevailing wind condition were 290° with a 18 knots crosswind and temperature of 24° .The airplane then had to wait for another A320 to depart at 1322, which took-off with prevailing wind conditions of 290° with a 23 kts crosswind. At 1335 the Global 5000 was finally cleared for take-off from runway 36. The wind condition at that time was 300° at 18 kts with gustiness and a temperature of 24°.The aircrew performed a rolling take-off and the acceleration was normal, the pilot nonflying (NPF) called for air speed alive, 80 knots, V1 and Rotate. Before approaching the south taxiway abeam the terminal building, the aircraft started to veer to the left side of the runway centerline.The aircraft continued to roll veering to the left side of the runway and the left hand main landing gear was already out of the runway after the north taxiway. The aircraft suffered a runway excursion and sustained substantial damage after simultaneous collision with the concrete bases of runway edge lights and to the concrete culvert before it came to a complete stop at approximately 1500 meters from the take-off point.PROBABLE CAUSEThe Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was - Lack of recurrent training of the flight crewRoutine flights do not prepare a pilot for unusual situations, whether they are unexpected crosswinds or systems/engine anomalies. Pilots should receive regular recurrent training to include abnormal and emergency procedures.- The existing runway edge light designThe PIC tried to recover the aircraft back to the runway but apparently the aircraft left main landing gears already hit or bumped the concrete base of runway edge lights. The design of runway strips or shoulder must be free from fixed objects other than frangible visual aids provided for the guidance of aircraft and must notbe constructed with sharp edges; and where the lights will not normally come into contact with aircraft wheels, such as threshold lights, runway end lights and runway edge lights;- Human FactorsDue to deteriorating adverse weather conditions and due to the delay of their initial request for take-off clearance plus the sudden change of flight plan affected the Captains ability to perform a take-off procedure as recommended in the aircraft flight manual and instead delegated flight control duties to the F/O resulting in the loss of coordination between the flight crew.",Executive,,2015

Swiss International Air Lines flight LX1189 was preparing for departure to Zurich, Switzerland and the doors of the aircraft were closed. The aircraft was being de-iced when the de-icing employee heard the APU revving up. This was followed by a loud bang. After a second loud bang the APU stopped. Debris from the APU engine penetrated the pressure bulkhead and smoke appeared in the passenger cabin. The passengers were directed to the front of the cabin and all occupants left the plane through the forward exit.The APU air intake is located on the right of the fuselage, on the transition from the fin to the fuselage. De-icing fluid can easily enter through the open air intake when the APU is in operation. Furthermore, the de-icing agent causes a strong fog when applied, due to the difference in temperature. This restricts the visibility of the air intake. In addition, the area around the air inlet of the APU is not marked, making it harder to notice the location of the intake.The BFU notes that a safety recommendation of the NTSB following a similar accident, requested the APU to be switched off when the aircraft is de-iced. This measure had not been implemented in Europe.ConclusionsThe failure of the APU and the resulting consequential damage was due to the intake and combustion of de-icing fluid. Visual restrictions and inadequate marking have contributed to the accident.",International Scheduled Passenger,BFU Germany ,2015

The aircraft took off at 0700 hours local time.Prior to departure the flight crew had been briefed that in the area of the Rhodes Airport the winds were S-SE at 17 kt with wind gust to 36 kt.For winds like these, the Rhodes (LGRP) AIP stated ""Pilots landing or taking off at RODOS/ DIAGORAS Airport should exercise extreme caution when South or SouthEast (S-SE) winds of more than 15 Kts prevail, as moderate or severe turbulence and wind shear may be encountered on the final approach and/or initial climb out areas (mainly of RWY 07).""At 0723 hrs., approximately 12 min prior to landing, in the first contact of the flight crew with the Control Tower of Rhodes Airport, the flight crew was told winds were variable with a direction from 20° to 160°, average wind direction from 110°, wind velocity 20 kt gusting 38 kt.As laid down in the airport procedures, ATC, given the weather conditions, alerted the fire service vehicles to be stationed in readiness at their designated positions on the taxiways.Rhodes ATC then reminded the flight crew that as a result of the strong wind shear and turbulence, landing at the airport was not recommended under the circumstances.At 0729 Rhodes ATC contacted the flight, informing that the wind was shifting from 40° to 260°, average wind direction from 120°, mean wind velocity 20 kt and wind gust 32 kt.Three minutes later, at about 8 nm from the airport, ATC contacted the flight crew again and informed that wind in the last ten minutes was shifting in all directions, with mean wind velocity 16 kt and wind gust 37 kt; ATC also repeated that under these conditions landing was not recommended.At 0734, at about 4 nm to the airport, Rhodes ATC gave the crew a weather update wind was shifting from 60° to 200°, mean wind velocity 15 kt, wind gust 32 kt and runway 07 was free for landing.One minute later ATC reported wind direction from 110°, 17kt.Given the prevailing winds, landing with 9° flaps and an airspeed of about 129 kt was selected by the crew. The flight continued to land and touched down at 0736, with the right main landing gear touching down first.During deceleration immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and came to rest at the left edge of the runway without exiting the runway.Probable Causes The decision to perform a landing following a non-stabilized approach.Landing with a strong and variable wind, the speed and the crosswind component of which were in excess of the values specified by the standard operating procedures, the aircraft manufacturer and the recommendations for the said aerodrome in AIP GREECE.The failure to adhere to CRM principles.02-02-201502-02-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIASB ,2015

Forty-three occupants on board the airplane suffered fatal injuries. Fifteen were injured.The airplane took off from Taipei-Sung Shan Airport's runway 10 at 1051 hours local time and turned right, climbing to an altitude of 1350 feet. At 1052 the master warning sounded in the cockpit associated with the right engine (no. 2) flame out procedure message. Some 26 seconds later the left hand (no. 1) power lever was retarded to flight idle. After twenty seconds the left engine condition lever was set to the fuel shutoff position resulting in left engine shutdown.Instead of continuing the climbing right hand turn, the airplane had turned left and began losing altitude and speed with several stall warnings sounding in the cockpit. At 1053, the flight contacted the Sung Shan Tower controller declaring a Mayday and reporting an 'engine flameout'. The airplane then turned to the right while the crew attempted to restart the left hand engine.This succeeded at 105420 hours. Fourteen seconds later the stall warning sounded in the cockpit. Video footage of the accident show that the airplane banked almost 90 degrees left as it hit a taxi on a viaduct. Parts of the left hand wing broke off upon hitting the barrier of the viaduct. The airplane broke up as it impacted the Keelung River and came to rest inverted.Findings Related to Probable CausesPowerplant1. An intermittent signal discontinuity between the auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 and the torque sensor may have caused the automatic take off power control system (ATPCS)- Not being armed steadily during takeoff roll;- Being activated during initial climb which resulted in a complete ATPCS sequence including the engine number 2 autofeathering. 2. The available evidence indicated the intermittent discontinuity between torque sensor and auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 was probably caused by the compromised soldering joints inside the AFU number 2. Flight Operations3. The flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light during the initial stages of the take off roll.4. TransAsia did not have a clear documented company policy with associated instructions, procedures, and notices to crew for ATR72-600 operations communicating the requirement to reject the take off if the automatic take off power control system did not arm. 5. Following the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2, the flight crew failed to perform the documented failure identification procedure before executing any actions. That resulted in pilot flying's confusion regarding the identification and nature of the actual propulsion system malfunction and he reduced power on the operative engine number 1. 6. The flight crew's non-compliance with TransAsia Airways ATR72-600 standard operating procedures - Abnormal and Emergency Procedures for an engine flame out at take off resulted in the pilot flying reducing power on and then shutting down the wrong engine. 7. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated a series of stall warnings, including activation of the stick pusher. The crew did not respond to the stall warnings in a timely and effective manner.8. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time to restart an engine. The aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which the aircraft could not recover from loss of control. 9. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management (TEM) were less than effective, and compromised the safety of the flight. Both operating crew members failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines at different points in the occurrence sequence. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to or integrate input from the pilot monitoring.04-02-201504-02-201504-02-201504-02-201504-02-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ASC ,2015

All four occupants sustained fatal injuries.The airplane had undergone routine maintenance in Miami and was returning to Venezuela at the time of the accident. An NTSB review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine. The flight was cleared for takeoff at 143645 hours local time. At 143815, one of the pilots reported an ""engine failure"" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 4,5 km west of the runway.The highest altitude recorded on radar was 300 feet. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin. It appeared that the no.1 engine prop feathered after takeoff and that the engine was shut down prior to the accident.PROBABLE CAUSE "" The left engine propeller's uncommanded travel to the feathered position during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined due to impact damage. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to establish a coordinated climb once the left engine was shut down and the left propeller was in the feathered position.""11-02-201511-02-201511-02-2015",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2015

The aircraft performed an ILS approach and landed on runway 27. On touchdown, the aircraft pulled to the left and the co-pilot reported that there was no brake pressure. The commander suspected a tyre had burst and that hydraulic pressure had been lost. He therefore changed to the alternative braking system, slowed the aircraft and vacated the runway.

M...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20150224-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) - Ground,"Air Canada Express flight 7795 was a scheduled domestic flight from Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Canada, to Sault Ste. Marie Airport.On board the DHC-8-102 aircraft were 15 passengers, 2 flight crew members, and 1 cabin crew member. The captain performed the role of pilot flying (PF) and the first officer performed the role of pilot monitoring (PM).Just prior to descent from cruise altitude, the PF briefed the PM for the expected approach into Sault Ste. Marie. The PF was aware of the marginal weather conditions and included the possibility of a go-around and diversion in the briefing.As part of the briefing, the flight crew set the approach speed bugs to the appropriate speed for aircraft weight and flight conditions. The crew determined that the applicable landing reference speed (Vref) was 96 knots, which required an approach speed bug setting of 101 knots.When the aircraft was approximately 42 nautical miles (nm) from CYAM, the controller at the Toronto Area Control Centre cleared the flight to descend to 5000 feet above sea level (ASL) and, given the expected weather conditions, requested that the crew report when they had the airport in sight for the visual approach.As AC7795 reached 15 nm from Sault Ste. Marie in level flight at 5000 feet ASL, the crew reported that the in-flight visibility was reduced due to ice crystals. In consideration of this, they requested to be cleared for the VOR/DME approach to runway 30, rather than the visual approach, and were cleared as requested.While descending out of 3000 feet ASL, the flight crew passed through the area of ice crystals and acquired the airport visually. Although the flight was now in visual conditions, the crew noticed a significant snow shower approaching the arrival runway from the west. They reported these conditions to the controller, who cleared the flight for the visual approach, instructing them to deviate as necessary from the VOR approach.At 182134 the aircraft passed over the final approach fix, 8.7 nm from the runway threshold, at a height of 2840 feet above ground level (AGL) and an indicated airspeed of 204 knots. The aircraft was descending on a 3° vertical path, although this was done visually, rather than with avionics-based vertical navigation guidance.The aircraft slowly decelerated from 204 to 181 knots while maintaining the 3° vertical path in descent from 2840 feet to 1500 feet.At 182250, when AC7795 was 5 nm from Sault Ste. Marie, the flight crew contacted the Sault Ste. Marie control tower for landing clearance. The controller informed the crew that the wind was from 310° magnetic (M) at 22 knots with gusts to 29 knots, and mentioned the line of weather currently rolling across the runway. The controller further informed the crew that, due to this weather, the runway visual range (RVR) visibility had decreased to 1100 feet, with the runway lights set to level 4 intensity. The PM responded that they could see the approaching weather.At 182305 and at 1500 feet, the power levers were moved toward flight idle and the engine torque reduced to between 3% and 4%. The aircraft began to decelerate more rapidly.The tower controller then informed AC7795 that the RVR had now reduced to 1000 feet, with the runway lights now at level 5 (full) intensity. Wind was reported as from 310°M at 25 knots, and JZA7795 was cleared to land.At 182349, at 1000 feet and 2.8 nm from the runway threshold, the flaps were extended to 15° and the PF increased torque to 25%. The aircraft's airspeed was 148 knots.Between 1000 feet and 500 feet on approach, the aircraft generally maintained the 3° vertical path as the speed decreased from 148 to 122 knots. The engine torque varied during that time between 5% and 30% to account for configuration changes and wind gusts.At 500 feet, the airspeed was 122 knots, or 21 knots higher than the bugged approach speed of 101 knots. The aircraft was on the appropriate vertical path and torque was steady at 25%. The PF made the 8° left turn to align the aircraft with the runway heading.At 182456, air traffic control (ATC) provided one last update to JZA7795, stating that the RVR was now 1200 feet.At 200 feet and at an airspeed of 124 knots, the PF began to reduce torque to idle and, as a result, the airspeed began to decrease rapidly. Although the aircraft's nose-up pitch was gradually increased and vertical speed was relatively stable, the vertical path steepened due to the decreasing airspeed and resultant ground speed reduction. The aircraft drifted below the 3° vertical path. This would normally be visually indicated by 4 red lights on the precision approach path indicator (PAPI), meaning the aircraft is too low.At some point below 200 feet, the flight crew lost visual reference to the ground due to the approaching weather system of blowing snow. The approach was continued.At 182515, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) issued a verbal alert to the pilots indicating that the aircraft's height was 50 feet.Then, at 20 feet, torque was increased toward 30%. At 182519, the aircraft contacted the ground approximately 450 feet (137 meters) prior to the runway threshold at an airspeed of 94 knots.The ground preceding the runway was covered in approximately 8 to 12 inches of snow.The aircraft was in a level pitch attitude when it contacted the surface and touched down with a peak vertical acceleration of 2.32g.Following touchdown, the nose landing gear assembly and wheel struck and damaged an approach light located 300 feet prior to the runway threshold. The flight crew heard a thump, but had not seen the light and were unsure what had caused the noise.The aircraft came to a stop on the runway centreline, approximately 1500 feet past the threshold. The flight crew assessed the ground visibility as very poor, due to the blowing snow.Unsure of the aircraft's status, the flight crew informed the tower controller that the aircraft may have landed short of the runway and may have clipped the nosewheel. The crew asked the control tower to send a vehicle to their position to assess the situation, and requested that a bus be sent to move the passengers.When the emergency vehicles arrived and assessed the condition of the aircraft, no significant damage was noticed. Upon receiving this information, the flight crew elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate.The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident, and the crew shut down the engines and deplaned the passengers.The crew did not believe there was damage to the aircraft and, therefore, did not pull the circuit breaker to prevent the cockpit voice recorder data from being overwritten. As a result, relevant data that would have been captured on the 30-minute cockpit voice recorder was overwritten while the aircraft remained electrically powered at the gate.After exiting the aircraft at the gate, the crew was notified of damage to an approach light and contacted maintenance to have the aircraft inspected.The aircraft sustained significant damage, mostly localized to the area near the nose landing gear, which had struck the approach light.The nose gear and nose gear doors were damaged and required replacement. Additionally, both main landing gear were determined to have exceeded load limits and required replacement.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The company standard operating procedures require an approach speed of Vref + 5 knots; however, this is being interpreted by flight crews as a target to which they should decelerate, from 120 knots, once the aircraft is below 500 feet. As a result, the majority of examined approaches, including the occurrence approach, were unstable, due to this deceleration.2. Due to ambiguity in the guidance and uncertainty as to the required speeds during the approach, the crew did not recognize that the approach was unstable, and continued.3. On the approach, the pilot flying reduced power to idle to reduce the approach speed from 122 knots toward 101 knots at 200 feet above ground level. This steepened the aircraft's vertical path.4. The rapidly decreasing visibility resulted in the airport environment and the precision approach path indicator lights becoming obscured; as a result, the steepened vertical profile went unnoticed and uncorrected.5. Although the loss of visual reference required a go-around, the crew continued the approach to land as a result of plan continuation bias.6. The terrain awareness and warning system did not alert the crew to the aircraft's proximity to the ground once the aircraft was below 50 feet, possibly due to the rapid rate of closure. This lack of warning contributed to the crew not being aware of the aircraft's height above ground.7. Due to the uncorrected steepened vertical profile, loss of visual reference, and lack of normal terrain warning, the aircraft contacted the surface approximately 450 feet prior to the runway threshold.Findings as to risk1. If guidance provided to flight crews allows for large tolerance windows, and crews are not trained to recognize an unstable condition, then there is a continued risk that flights that are unstable will be continued to a landing.2. If approaches that require excessive deceleration below established stabilization heights are routinely flown, then there is a continued risk of an approach or landing accident.3. If crews do not report unstable approaches and operators do not conduct flight data monitoring but rely only on safety management system reports to determine the frequency of unstable approaches, there is a risk that these issues will persist and contribute to an accident.24-02-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2015

The pilot was not injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated from Newark Liberty International (EWR), New Jersey and was destined for BWI. Following an uneventful flight, the pilot landed the airplane on runway 33R at BWI, before exiting to the left onto taxiway J. The airplane then continued to taxi to the southwest and transitioned onto taxiway AA. As the airplane approached the intersection of the taxiway and a service road, a ground service vehicle approached from the airplane's right. The pilot applied the airplane's brakes and full reverse thrust, and the airplane came to a stop. The ground service vehicle passed in front of the airplane at an estimated distance of between two and three feet, and the vehicle and the airplane did not collide.The pilot stated that the ""hard"" braking and reverse thrust application caused the nose landing gear strut to compress, resulting in a ""spring effect that was multiplied by removing reverse thrust rapidly."" The airplane then pitched up and the empennage struck the ground, resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. The pilot reported that there were no pre-accident mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane's systems.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The ground service vehicle operator's failure to yield right of way to the airplane due to distraction, which necessitated the pilot's use of reverse thrust and braking to avoid a collision and resulted in the airplane's empennage striking the ground.""24-02-2015",Cargo,NTSB ,2015

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight from Marathon-Florida Keys Airport (MTH), Florida. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 1554.The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles.The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry. When the flight was abeam runway 17, the landing gear was lowered and the flaps were extended to 30 degrees. The landing checklist was performed, and the anti-skid test was normal. The thrust reversers were armed, and he performed a ""teardrop turn"" to final. With flaps at 45 degrees, gear down, and flying Vref plus 10 knots, a couple of gusts were encountered during the approach. The co-pilot checked the AWOS again; the wind was still 250 degrees at 5 knots. He maintained a normal glide path at Vref plus 4 or 5 knots at the runway threshold, where he positioned both thrust levers to idle. The airplane was landed firm about 300 to 500 feet beyond the aiming point marking, and after touchdown he was unable to extend the ground spoilers. When the nose landing gear contacted the runway, he applied ""moderate"" brakes and held the control yoke forward, but felt no deceleration. He also attempted to deploy the thrust reversers but was unable.The PIC informed the co-pilot there was no braking energy and released the brakes; the anti-skid was turned off and the brakes were re-applied pressing hard. He did not feel any deceleration, and again tried to deploy the thrust reversers, but was unable. He kept the airplane on the runway centerline, and began modulating the brakes. Unable to stop the airplane he added right rudder input causing the airplane to veer to the right. The airplane went off the end of the runway into sand causing the nose landing gear to collapse. After coming to rest he ordered an emergency evacuation, and secured the engines.PROBABLE CAUSE The failure of a spring inside the No. 2 brakes upper brake control valve and the fracture of the coupling subassembly of the No. 1 wheel speed sensor during landing, which resulted in the loss of braking action, and the pilot-in-commands (PIC) deactivation of the antiskid system even though there were no antiskid failure annunciations, which resulted in the rupture of the Nos. 1, 3, and 4 tires, further loss of braking action, and subsequent landing overrun. Contributing to accident were the PICs improper landing flare, which resulted in landing several hundred feet beyond the aiming point marking, and his unsuccessful attempts to deploy the thrust reversers for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident operational testing did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Contributing to the passengers injury was his leaving his seat intentionally while the airplane was in motion.01-03-201501-03-201501-03-201501-03-201501-03-2015",Executive,NTSB ,2015

The flight was the first international flight to scheduled to arrive that morning. After descending from cruising altitude, it entered a holding pattern at FL210 at 0612 hours local time (0027 UTC) until about 0700 (0115 UTC) when it was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned at about the Missed Approach Point at 1DME and the aircraft performed a go around. The aircraft circled and positioned for a second approach to runway 02. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway centerline with the left hand main gear off the paved runway surface. It ran onto soft soil and the nose landing gear collapsed.The aircraft touched down at to the left of the centerline because the FMGS NAV database contained threshold coordinates for a proposed displacement of the runway 02 threshold. This was later withdrawn through a NOTAM, but had not been updated by the airline in the FMGS. Additionally, the coordinates that were initially published were inaccurate, causing the threshold coordinates to be offset to the left of the actual threshold. This had been noticed and reported by a previous Turkish Airlines flight on March 2. The changes to the FMGS had not been performed by the time TC-JOC landed at Kathmandu.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The decision of the flight crew to continue approach and landing below the minima with inadequate visual reference and not to perform a missed approach in accordance to the published approach procedure.

The 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 98 of the 127 passengers were not injured; the other 29 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged. Flight 1086 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, where it departed at 0923 hours local time. Given the winter weather conditions at LaGuardia, the flight crew was concerned about the available landing distance on runway 13 (7003 ft / 2135 m). While en route to LGA they spent considerable time analyzing the airplanes stopping performance.The flight crew also requested braking action reports about 45 and 35 minutes before landing, but none were available at those times because of runway snow clearing operations. The unavailability of braking actions reports and the uncertainty about the runways condition created some situational stress for the captain, who was the pilot flying.After runway 13 became available for arriving airplanes, the flight crews of two preceding airplanes (which landed on the runway about 16 and 8 minutes before the accident landing) reported good braking action on the runway, so the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runways surface after the airplane broke out of the clouds. However, the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow, which was inconsistent with their expectations based on the braking action reports and the snow clearing operations that had concluded less than 30 minutes before the airplane landed. The snowier-than-expected runway, along with the relatively short runway length and the presence of Flushing Bay directly off the departure end of the runway, most likely increased the captains concerns about his ability to stop the airplane within the available runway distance, which exacerbated his situational stress. The captain made a relatively aggressive reverse thrust input almost immediately after touchdown. Both pilots were aware that 1.3 EPR was the target setting for contaminated runways.As reverse thrust EPR was rapidly increasing, the captains attention was focused on other aspects of the landing, which included steering the airplane to counteract a slide to the left and ensuring that the spoilers had deployed, which was a necessary action for the autobrakes to engage. The maximum EPR values reached during the landing were 2.07 on the left engine and 1.91 on the right engine, which were much higher than the target setting of 1.3 EPR. These high EPR values likely resulted from a combination of the captains stress; his relatively aggressive reverse thrust input; and operational distractions, including the airplanes continued slide to the left despite the captains efforts to steer it away from the snowbanks alongside the runway. All of these factors reduced the captains monitoring of EPR indications. The high EPR values caused rudder blanking, which occurs on MD-80 series airplanes when smooth airflow over the rudder is disrupted by high reverse thrust, and a subsequent loss of aerodynamic directional control. Although the captain stowed the thrust reversers and applied substantial right rudder, right nosewheel steering, and right manual braking, the airplanes departure from the left side of the runway could not be avoided because directional control was regained too late to be effective.The airplane departed the left side of runway 13 about 3,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. The tracks were on a heading of about 10 degrees from the runway heading.About 4,100 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplanes left wing initially struck the airports perimeter fence, which is located on top of the berm, and the airplane tracks turn back parallel with runway 13. About 5,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane came to rest with its nose over the berm. The left wing of the airplane destroyed about 940 feet of the perimeter fence.PROBABLE CAUSEThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captains inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplanes heading. Contributing to the accident were the captains (1) situational stress resultingfrom his concern about stopping performance and (2) attentional limitations due to the high workload during the landing, which prevented him from immediately recognizing the use of excessive reverse thrust.05-03-201505-03-201505-03-201505-03-201505-03-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2015

At the time the visibility reported for Hubli was 10 km. When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm.Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain.Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short final to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally. The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well. Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation. There was no injury to any of the occupants on board the aircraft. There was no postaccident fire.Probable cause of the accidentLoss of visual cues after touch down in inclemental weather conditions resulted in veering of the aircraft towards left of the centerline leading to runway excursion and accident.Following are the contributory factors.1. Inappropriate handling technique of the aircraft controls by the PIC to maintain the directional control of the aircraft after landing.2. Non-standards callouts by the first officer to correct situation after landing.3. Impact of the landing gear with the non-frangible erected runway edge light resulted in retraction of the same.4. At the time of the accident DGCA O.M. No. AV.15026/006/92- AS dated 3rd February 1992 was in force, which dictated examiners and instructors of the operators only to carry out trial procedures in VMC and during Daytime only. M/s Spice jet instructions to the flight crew did not reflect the same and allowed flight crew with less experience & below VMC flight conditions to carry out trial procedures. This may have contributed to the accident.08-03-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2015

The co-pilot performed the external checks; this included checking the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. The aircraft was refuelled to 3,000 lb and, after the passengers boarded, it departed for Blackpool. The commander was the pilot flying (PF).The takeoff and cruise to Blackpool were uneventful. The commander planned and briefed for the NDB approach to runway 10, which was to be flown with the autopilot engaged. Whilst descending through FL120, the left, followed by the right, hydraulic low pressure cautions illuminated. Upon checking the hydraulic pressure gauge, the pressure was noted to be cycling up and down, but for the majority of the time it indicated about 2,800 psi (in the green arc). During this time the hydraulic low pressure cautions went on and off irregularly, with the left caution being on more often than the right. The co-pilot then actioned the HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILURE checklist. It stated that if the hydraulic pressure was a minimum of 2,800 psi, the flight could be continued.Just before the aircraft reached the Blackpool NDB, the commander commented ""its dropping"", but he could not recall what he was referring to. This was followed by the roll fail and speed brk [brake] fail caution messages illuminating. The co-pilot then actioned the applicable checklists. These stated that the Landing Distances Required (LDR) would increase by approximately 65% and 21%, respectively. As the roll fail LDR increase was greater than that of the speed brk fail, the crew used an LDR increase of 65% which the co-pilot equated to 5,950 ft. Runway 10 at Blackpool has an LDA of 6,131 ft, therefore they elected to continue to Blackpool.The roll fail checklist stated that a FLAPS UP landing was required. The co-pilot then calculated the VREF of 132 kt, including a 20 kt increment, as stipulated by the FLAPS UP, 10, OR 20 APPROACH AND LANDING checklist. The commander then continued with the approach.At about 4 nm on final approach the co-pilot lowered the landing gear, in response to the commanders request. About 8 seconds later the commander said ""just lost it all""; referring to the general state of the aircraft. This was followed almost immediately by the landing gear unsafe aural warning, as the main landing gear was not indicating down and locked. Whilst descending through 1,000 ft, at just over 3 nm from the threshold, the commander asked the co-pilot to action the ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION checklist.The commander then discontinued the approach by selecting ALT HOLD, increased engine thrust and selected a 500 ft/min rate of climb on the autopilot. However, a few seconds later, before the co-pilot could action the checklist, the main gear indicated down and locked. The commander disconnected the autopilot and continued the approach. The crew did not consider reviewing the HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILURE checklist as they had not recognised the symptoms of loss of hydraulic pressure.When ATC issued the aircraft its landing clearance the wind was from 140° at 17 kt. This equated to a headwind component of about 10 kt and a crosswind of about 12 kt. As the aircraft descended through 500 ft (the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach) at 1.5 nm from the threshold, the commander instructed the co-pilot to advise ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and to request the RFFS to be put on standby. There was a slight delay in transmitting this request, due to another aircraft on frequency, but the request was acknowledged by ATC.The aircraft touched down about 1,500 ft from the start of the paved surface at an airspeed of 132 kt and a groundspeed of 124 kt. When the commander applied the toe (power) brakes he felt no significant retardation. During the landing roll no attempt was made to apply the emergency brakes, as required in the event of a power brake failure. The co-pilot asked if he should try to operate the lift dump, but it failed to function, due to the lack of hydraulic pressure. At some point, while the aircraft was on the runway, the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call to ATC. When an overrun appeared likely, the commander shut down the engines. The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the runway at a groundspeed of about 80 kt. The commander later commented that he was in a ""state of panic"" during the landing roll and was unsure whether or not he had applied the emergency brake.As the aircraft left the paved surface the commander steered the aircraft slightly right to avoid a shallow downslope to the left of runways extended centreline. The aircraft continued across the rough, uneven ground, during which the nose gear collapsed and the wing to fuselage attachments were severely damaged. Once it had come to a stop, he shut down the remaining aircraft systems. The passengers and crew, who were uninjured, vacated the aircraft via the entry/exit door and moved upwind to a safe distance.The investigation determined that, irrespective of the omission to apply the emergency brakes, the Landing Distance Available (LDA) at Blackpool was insufficient for the aircraft to land with a hydraulic failure.  A fatigue crack in the port cap1 of the left hydraulic pump had caused a hydraulic leak which eventually resulted in the total loss of the hydraulic system.12-03-201512-03-2015",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2015

Purpose of the flight was to carry out flight inspections to confirm the required performance of aeronautical navigation facilities. The captain was Pilot Flying.While the aircraft was flying south-southwest on Airway V31 toward the Niigata VORTAC at an altitude 9,000 ft, the captain and the first officer sighted a lower layer of clouds but had visually confirmed that there was no cloud on the flight route in the vicinity of Niigata Airport. At about 1432, the aircraft commenced a descending turn from right above Niigata Airport in order to inspect on the next airway. At this time, the captain and the first officer had checked on an indication on the weather radar display of the aircraft showing a precipitation area, albeit not on their route, and were therefore focusing attention in that direction. They then encountered scattered thin clouds, but this was judged not to be thick clouds which might lead to turbulence or thunder. At about 1435, as the aircraft entered the thin cloud at an altitude about 6,500 ft, a very loud noise was heard on the radio equipment while the captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer were listening to it. After three to four seconds, the captain and the first officer received an impact accompanied by a loud popping noise, together with a strong flash from the front of the aircraft.While continuing the flight, the captain and the first officer checked the instruments to check whether abnormality had occurred to the aircraft; consequently, they confirmed that discoloration was found on some of the cockpit instrument displays, and that the airborne DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) display on the captain's side had disappeared. However, there was no abnormality in the DME display on the first officer's side and there was no problem with the visibility of the discolored instrument displays; accordingly, they judged there to be no serious abnormality which would affect the flight.The captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer discussed whether they should continue the flight inspection, and although there was thought to be no hindrance to the flight, they decided to suspend the flight and return to the base of the aircraft at Tokyo International Airport, because they could not confirm damage to the airframe while on board. Thereafter the aircraft landed at Tokyo International Airport at 1526. On the post-flight inspection, damage was confirmed to the left front fuselage outer skins, the front lower fuselage and the left horizontal stabilizer.PROBABLE CAUSES ""It is probable that this accident occurred because the aircraft sustained damage to the outer skins of its left front lower fuselage as a result of being struck by lightning to the airframe in flight.It is probable that the lightning strike was occurred because the aircraft came close to the electrically charged cumulus clouds in the scattered thin cloud where it was difficult to predict lightning.""13-03-2015","Aerial Work (Calibration, Photo)",JTSB ,2015
14-MAR-2015,Airbus A330-343,9M-MTA,Malaysia Airlines,0,Melbourne-Tu...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20150314-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Heavy landing Runway mishap,"On 14 March 2015, at about 0750 LT an Airbus A330-343 aircraft operated by Malaysia Airlines, began its final approach to runway 34 at Melbourne Airport in Australia. The flight was a regular passenger service from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Melbourne. The flight crew consisted of a captain, who was the pilot flying (PF) and a first officer, who was pilot monitoring (PM).The approach to runway 34 at Melbourne airport was not equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), so a non-precision approach was performed, aided by PAPI lights. Flight data showed that the PF disengaged the autopilot at approximately 700 feet above ground level (AGL) and from that point until touchdown there was an increase in the frequency and magnitude of sidestick pitch control inputs by the PF.In response to these inputs the aircrafts autothrottle system varied the engine thrust to maintain a target speed, as per system design, and the aircraft pitch angles fluctuated between approximately -0.5° nose down and +5.0° nose up. The net result of the varying thrust settings and pitch angles was a fluctuating rate of descent between approximately 380 and 960 feet per minute.Large sidestick inputs, specifically nose-down, also have the potential to inhibit the vertical speed reduction function, which is an automated function that provides some protection against touchdown at very high vertical speeds.As the aircraft passed 300 feet a rate of descent of 960 feet per minute was recorded. This neared the operators maximum stabilised approach limit of 1000 feet per minute when below 500 feet AGL. As well as a high rate of descent, actual exceedances of the operators stabilisation criteria included large changes to pitch inputted by the pilot flying, including negative pitch values, fluctuations in the rate of descent over a large range that were abnormal for the phase of flight, incorrect glide path. From approximately 250 feet AGL, the aircraft was trending low and continuing below the glide path. At this point the pilots would have been able to observe 3 red lights and one white light on the PAPI. This trend was allowed to continue until the aircraft was well below the desired glide path to the extent that the PAPI would have indicated 4 red lights from approximately 125 feet AGL. From this point the PF made numerous pitch commands which were mostly nose down. These included a full range nose down deflection at 24 feet AGL.The company procedures and manufacturers recommendations dictated that if an approach becomes unstable below 500 feet AGL, a go-around must be initiated by the pilot flying (PF) and/or the pilot monitoring (PM) must alert the PF of the unstable approach and encourage a go-around.At 60 feet AGL the captain moved the thrust levers forward momentarily into the TOGA (Take-off/Go Around) detent. The captain stated that this was done in response to a feeling that the aircraft was sinking below the path, and the intention was to reduce this sink by applying more thrust to the engines. The placement of the thrust lever into TOGA placed the aircraft automation into the go-around autopilot modes and changed the display on the primary flight display flight mode annunciator (FMA). The captain subsequently reduced the thrust levers.The PM, on seeing the modes on the FMA change assumed that a go-around was being conducted and awaited further announcement from the captain. The PM reported noticing the thrust levers reducing and that the aircraft was not flaring and applied nose up input to the sidestick at the same time as the PF.At the time of the occurrence there was no procedure on the A330 for the use of manual thrust for this purpose. Prior to 2009, a procedure existed in the Airbus A330 documentation that allowed a specific use of manual thrust in difficult environmental conditions. Airbus advised that after an analysis of in-service events the procedure was removed from all operational documents. Manipulation of the thrust levers in this manner had the effect of disengaging the autothrottle thereby inhibiting some of the available auto flight system protections including the target speed function (which automatically maintained the desired speed and adjusted for fluctuation in the wind), and the vertical speed reduction function.It also caused a pitch up tendency which usually requires a large nose down input by the pilot flying to prevent the aircraft from pitching up. At this stage in the approach applying large nose down inputs differed from the gradual nose up input normally required to complete the flare.Furthermore, it resulted in breaking down of the shared mental model between the pilot flying and pilot monitoring in that the pilot monitoring believed the advancement of the thrust levers was the initiation of a go-around.Shortly after this action, the aircraft touched down at a vertical speed of approximately 700 feet per minute and a vertical acceleration of 2.61 G was recorded. The aircraft also touched down at approximately 170m (560 feet) from the landing threshold, short of the normal touchdown zone of between 304m (1000 feet) and 609m (2000 feet).The manufacturer of the aircraft produced a complete load analysis of the event based on recorded flight data provided by the operator. The conclusion of this analysis was that several components in the left and right gear had ""exceeded their design load limits and may have been detrimentally overloaded"".There were no injuries reported as a result of the hard landing.The airplane remained at Melbourne until March 26, when it was ferried at low altitude to Darwin, Australia, and continuing to Kuala Lumpur the next day for further repairs.Contributing factors- The final approach became unstable at around 300 feet above the ground due to the control inputs from the captain.- Inadequate monitoring and communication by the crew led to a lack of recognition of the undesirable flight state and the continuation of an unstable approach.- Continuation of the unstable approach led to a high rate of descent at touchdown and resulted in a hard landing in excess of the aircraft design loads and short of the normal touchdown area.Other safety factorsThe captain used an unapproved manual thrust procedure in an attempt to recover the approach",International Scheduled Passenger,ATSB ,2015

All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed.Flight 4U9525 departed Barcelona, Spain at 1000 hours local time (0900 UTC) on a regular passenger service to Düsseldorf, Germany. The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 1027 hours. At 1030 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight.At 103008, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged.At 103053, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The airplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased.At 103312, the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode. One second later, the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane's speed was 273 kt. The aeroplane's speed started to increase along with the descent rate, which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min, then was on average about 3,500 ft/min.The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt. At 103347, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot. Over the following 30 seconds, the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions, without any answer.Thereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt. Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react.Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response.The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door.At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success.As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 103930 and 104028.The GPWS then sounded ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up"" until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters.CausesThe collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit. The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the privilege of his licence.The following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle- the co-pilot's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME;- the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly;- the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality.Security requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons. This made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps.24-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-201524-03-2015",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2015

The airplane sustained substantial damage. 23 occupants were injured.Flight 624 departed from Toronto at 2105 hours local time (0105 UTC). At 2340 hours local time (0240 UTC) the aircraft entered a holding pattern to the west of Halifax. Visibility was limited due to snowfall. The aircraft was then cleared for a Localizer (LOC-Z) approach to runway 05 at Halifax Airport. During final approach the aircraft severed powerlines located 250 m from the beginning of the paved surface of runway 05. The aircraft then impacted a localizer antenna array, located 70 m further on, and became airborne again. The Airbus slid onto the runway and came to rest near taxiway B.The nose cone was ripped off in the accident sequence and pieces of the antenna array were embedded in the nose of plane. Part of the undercarriage were sheared off and both engines separated. There was extensive damage to both wing leading edges and horizontal stabilizers and lower fuselage.The last flight landing at Halifax before the accident was AC118, an Embraer 190 from Ottawa, at 2150 hours local time. Two other incoming flights diverted and two were cancelled.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Air Canada's standard operating procedure (SOP) and practice when flying in flight path angle guidance mode was that, once the aircraft was past the final approach fix, the flight crews were not required to monitor the aircraft's altitude and distance from the threshold or to make any adjustments to the flight path angle. This practice was not in accordance with the flight crew operating manuals of Air Canada or Airbus.2. As per Air Canada's practice, once the flight path angle was selected and the aircraft began to descend, the flight crew did not monitor the altitude and distance from the threshold, nor did they make any adjustments to the flight path angle.3. The flight crew did not notice that the aircraft had drifted below and diverged from the planned vertical descent angle flight profile, nor were they aware that the aircraft had crossed the minimum descent altitude further back from the threshold.4. Considering the challenging conditions to acquire and maintain the visual cues, it is likely the flight crew delayed disconnecting the autopilot until beyond the minimum descent altitude because of their reliance on the autopilot system.5. The approach and runway lights were not changed from setting 4 to setting 5; therefore, these lights were not at their maximum brightness setting during the approach.6. The system to control the airfield lighting's preset selections for brightness setting 4 was not in accordance with the NAV CANADA Air Traffic Control Manual of Operations requirement for the omnidirectional approach lighting system to be at its brightest settings.7. The limited number of visual cues and the short time that they were available to the flight crew, combined with potential visual illusions and the reduced brightness of the approach and runway lights, diminished the flight crew's ability to detect that the aircraft's approach path was taking it short of the runway.8. The flight crew's recognition that the aircraft was too low during the approach would have been delayed because of plan continuation bias.9. The aircraft struck terrain approximately 740 feet short of the runway threshold, bounced twice, and then slid along the runway before coming to a rest approximately 1900 feet beyond the runway threshold.10. At some time during the impact sequence, the captain's head struck the glare shield because there were insufficient acceleration forces to lock the shoulder harness and prevent movement of his upper body.11. The first officer sustained a head injury and serious injury to the right eye as a result of striking the glare shield because the automatic locking feature of the right-side shoulder-harness inertia reel was unserviceable.12. A flight attendant was injured by a coffee brewer that came free of its mounting base because its locking system was not correctly engaged.13. Because no emergency was expected, the passengers and cabin crew were not in a brace position at the time of the initial impact.14. Most of the injuries sustained by the passengers were consistent with not adopting a brace position.29-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-201529-03-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2015

The pilots were not injured. The airplane was operated by a private company. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Caracas-Simón Bolívar International Airport, Venezuela about 1630.The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to fly the airplane to FXE for scheduled maintenance. About 2 hours and 15 minutes after departure, at flight level 430, the crew observed a red warning light indicating a maximum cabin differential pressure of 9.8 psi, followed by a red ""DOOR MAIN"" indication. The pilots donned oxygen masks and referenced the airplane's quick reference handbook. A loud ""bam"" sound was then heard in the cabin and the crew initiated an immediate descent. The cabin pressure outflow valve was opened manually and the airplane was leveled at 12,000 feet above mean sea level. The flight continued to FXE unpressurized and landed without further incident. After landing, the crew performed a walk-around inspection and found no obvious anomalies with the airplane.A subsequent inspection of the airplane by maintenance and engineering personnel revealed structural airframe damage, including a cracked floor beam, dimpled areas in the floor boards, damaged structure between ribs, and damaged wing links. An initial examination of the fuselage revealed that the outflow valve safety port, located on the outer fuselage, was completely plugged with a foreign material resembling dried dirt from a mud dauber.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The in-flight failure of the cabin pressurization relief/safety valve (CPRV) due to an obstruction of the CPRV static port, which allowed the airplane to overpressurize. The reason for the initial overpressurization condition could not be determined.""",Ferry/positioning,,2015
13-APR-2015,Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II,C-GSKC,Carson Air,2,near North Vancou...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20150413-0,En route (ENR),Destroyed,"Flightcrew member's alcohol, drug usage Pilot or passenger suicide  Airframe failure Loss of control","The Carson Air Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II was operating as flight 66, a weekday cargo flight between Vancouver International Airport (CYVR) and Fort St. John (CYXJ), British Columbia, Canada, with planned stops in Prince George (CYXS) and Dawson Creek (CYDQ).On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 0600. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 0615 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 0645.At 0703, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type.Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 0707, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 0708, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control.CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 0702 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached.The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 0709, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns.During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period.Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 1645. Both pilots had been fatally injured.Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period. An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captains liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period.The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the companys cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board.Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captains predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. For unknown reasons, the aircraft descended in the direction of flight at high speed until it exceeded its structural limits, leading to an in-flight breakup.2. Based on the captain's blood alcohol content, alcohol intoxication almost certainly played a role in the events leading up to the accident.13-04-201513-04-201513-04-201529 July 1977N61ZSouthern Airways1 July 1979N61ZRepublic AirlinesJuly 1980N61ZBritt Airways5 April 1986N61ZBritt Airways1 September 1990N61ZContinental ExpressJune 1992N61ZBerry AviationJuly 1993N235BABerry AviationMay 1996N235BASuperior AviationOctober 2006C-GSKCCarson Air16 February 2011C-GSKCCarson Air",Cargo,TSB Canada ,2015

The aircraft departed from Varanasi Airport at 1245 local time and the flight was normal till touch down on runway 19 on Khajuraho Airport. The captain was pilot flying and co-pilot was carrying out duty of Pilot Monitoring. The captain carried out an ILS approach and landing on runway 19 at Khajuraho Airport. At touchdown the aircraft pitch was 4.39° with a vertical deceleration of 1.65G and a touchdown speed of  120 kts (Vref -4kts). During landing roll, 15 seconds after touchdown, at speed 36 knots the left main landing gear aft trunnion pin broke and the aircraft started deviating to the left of the center line. The aircraft came to stop on the runway with damage to the left hand main landing gear and resting on the no.1 engine, nose and right hand landing gear. Hydraulic fluid spillage occurred due to damage to the main landing gear. An emergency evacuation was carried out on the runway. All four main doors, escape slides and four emergency over wing exits were opened. However, the passengers used two escape slides (L1 and R1) for evacuation. One cabin crew member received minor injuries (bruises) during evacuation.The runway was closed after the accident as aircraft became disabled on the runway.  The disabled aircraft was removed from the runway at 1645 hours.PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT ""The LH Aft landing Gear trunnion pin failed due to overload following fatigue growth.

The flight was cleared for a runway 28 RNAV (GNSS) approach. During the approach a local transient fog layer moved over the airport. The Runway Visual Range in the touchdown zone decreased rapidly as low as 350 m. After that, the value recovered and returned to the value of more than 1,800 m. After the pilot in command and the first officer talked that the appearance of the runway was slightly odd, Hiroshima Tower reported a Touchdown RVR of 1,700 m. After that the captain disengaged the autopilot. At that time the aircraft was flying at 1000 feet above airfield elevation. The aircraft then descended below the normal 3° glide path. At decision altitude, the captain called, ""Continue,"" and continued descending. Immediately after this, the first officer concernedly said, ""Runway was not in sight."" At this stage, the approach path was getting even lower but still remained uncorrected. The captain said, ""Wait a second,"" as the aircraft descended to a position which indicated four red lights on the PAPI, if visible. The captain instructed the first officer to check radio altitude carefully. Afterward, an Auto Radio Altitude call of ""300 ft"" and ""200 ft"" were announced in a short interval, then, the captain called out for executing a go-around, and commenced raising the nose. Accordingly, the pitch angle of the aircraft was just about to increase; however, immediately after that, the aircraft collided with the Localizer antenna array, which is located 325 m before the runway 28 threshold. The aircraft collided with the central parts of the LOC frame stand 6 m high with the both engines, both main landing gears, the flaps, the lower surface of fuselage and the horizontal stabilizers. Having collided with the LOC frame stand, the aircraft badly damaged lights of SALS and touched down on the grass area short of the runway 28 threshold with the fuselage tail, followed by the right and left main wheels followed.The aircraft smashed down ORL lights and proceeded on the runway. The left main gear folded due to severe damage, causing the left engine cowling to touch the runway surface. Subsequently, the airplane gradually veered off the runway to the left finally coming to a stop facing the southeast at the position in front of the airport boundary fence.When the purser came into the cockpit, she was told to wait and the captain gave priority to performing the Emergency Evacuation Checklist.Back in the cabin she heard flight attendants in the rear of the cabin calling and it seemed that smoke was coming up in the rear. She decided that an emergency evacuation was required, and proceeded to the forward left hand (L1) door. Having confirmed the inflation of the evacuation slide, she instructed the passengers to evacuate. The flight attendants then also began evacuating the passengers.All persons onboard were evacuated using the emergency slides and 27 persons suffered minor injuries.Probable CausesIt is certain that when landing on runway 28 at Hiroshima airport, the aircraft undershot and the PIC commenced executing a go-around; however, it collided with the Aeronautical Radio Navigation Aids located in front of runway 28 threshold, just before turning to climb. Regarding the fact that the aircraft undershot, it is probable that there might be following aspects in causes The PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below the approach height threshold (Decision Altitude DA); and as well, the first officer, as pilot-monitoring who should have monitored meteorological conditions and flight operations, did not make a call-out of go-around immediately when he could not see the runway at DA. Regarding the fact that the PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below DA, he did not comply with the regulations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and it is probable that there was a background factor that the education and trainings for compliance of rules in the company was insufficient. In addition, regarding the fact that the first officer did not make an assertion of go-around, it is probable that the Crew Resource Management (CRM) did not function appropriately14-04-201514-04-201514-04-201514-04-201514-04-201514-04-2015",International Scheduled Passenger,JTSB ,2015

After completing appropriate checklist items the pilot declared an emergency and diverted to Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Colorado, for an instrument approach and an otherwise uneventful landing at 2311. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the second stage turbine rotor from the right engine had separated. One portion of the rotor exited through the left side of the engine and nacelle structure, penetrated the right side of the fuselage, and came to rest inside the fuselage wall. Other portions of the separated rotor exited through the right side of the engine.

There were no significant injuries to the crew. Post-flight engineering analysis revealed that the mishap aircraft exceeded the Design Limit Load (DLL), thus rendering it unsafe for further flight. The mishap occurred on a medium risk flying qualities test sortie out to the edges of the flight envelope. The pilot was attempting to execute a Steady Heading Sideslip (SHSS) to the RUDDER Special Alert of the Advisory Caution and Warning System (ACAWS). This is normally a prohibited maneuver, but the Director of Operations at Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A3) signed a waiver approving the test team to fly to this limit. The MA exceeded 14.5° Angle of Sideslip (AoS), triggering the RUDDER Special Alert and continued increasing AoS until it departed controlled flight, eventually tumbling to an inverted position. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft recovered from the departure and the copilot took the controls to recover from the near vertical dive. In the process of the departure and recovery, the aircraft lost approximately 5,000 feet of altitude, experienced 3.19 times the normal force acceleration (Gs), and over sped the flaps by over 100 knots. The over G exceeded the aircraft's Design Limit Load.The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the MP's [Mishap Pilot's] excessive rudder input during the test point followed by inadequate rudder input to initiate a timely recovery from high AoS due to Overcontrolled/Undercontrolled Aircraft and Wrong Choice of Action During an Operation.Additionally, the AIB President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap Instrumentation and Warning System Issues, Spatial Disorientation, Confusion, and the fact the test team was Provided Inadequate Procedural Guidance or Publications.",Military,USAF AIB ,2015

Although, the launcher and the droop leading edge on the wing were damaged, the aircraft landed safely. The target winch is powered by a turbine, and the speed of the turbine is controlled by vent doors. The target winch had oversped due to a fault with the closed limit switch on the vent doors which prevented the doors from closing.The target accelerated during the latter stages of its recovery, causing it to strike the aircraft. The acceleration was probably due to an overspeed of the target winch as a result of the failure of the vent door closed limit switch preventing the vent doors from closing when commanded.

Repair cost to the aircraft is estimated at $62.4 million.The board president found by preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was a leak in the high-pressure oxygen system due to poor assembly of the system tubing at depot maintenance.Failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley properly caused an oxygen leak. This leak created a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut causing the tubing to become detached from the junction fitting, feeding more oxygen to the fire, increasing its size, and causing severe damage to the airframe, galley, and mission equipment onboard the aircraft.30-04-201530-04-201530-04-201530-04-2015",Military,USAF AIB ,2015

The pilot was not injured. The cross-country personal flight departed Palm Springs, California, about 1515 with a planned destination of Santa Ana, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The pilot reported that 10 minutes into the flight, he received an instrument flight rules flight plan from air traffic control (ATC). The cloud tops were at 8,500 feet and he was cleared to 6,000 ft, which put him in the clouds.Within minutes of entering the clouds, the airplane lost all electrical power, and the pilot lost contact with ATC. He climbed back out of the clouds and proceeded to the west; he found a hole in the clouds over the Pacific Ocean, descended, and turned southbound. He said partial electrical power was restored, and he tried to advise ATC of his problems. His transmissions were not understood, but he flew to Carlsbad, and received a green light from the tower personnel.He extended the landing gear and flaps but had no airspeed indicator. When the airplane touched down, the pilot realized that his landing gear had not extended. Witnesses reported that the airplane approached the runway and was faster than a normal landing, and the gear was still retracted.The pilot reported that after the loss of electrical power he did not perform any emergency procedures as the checklist was in a cabinet and not reachable; he was just trying to fly the airplane. The pilot stated that when he departed from Palm Springs, the generators were on. When asked if he attempted to reset the generators, he again stated that he did not do any emergency procedures except to fly the airplane. In a later interview, the pilot stated that he may have accidently turned on the starter switches, which would have turned off the generators and accounted for the loss of electrical power.A mechanic was dispatched to help defuel the airplane about 30 minutes after the accident. He reported that fuel was leaking from the right wing so he disconnected the battery. He opened an access panel but was unable to mechanically turn off the fuel selector valve (FSV). He reconnected the battery and went into the cockpit. He saw that the landing gear handle was in the down position, and the flap handle was in the full up position. The battery switch was in the OFF position with the battery gang bar down, which turned off the battery, generator 1, and generator 2. After lifting up the gang bar and turning on the battery switch, he saw nothing on the cockpit displays but heard the airplane power up. He located the FSV, turned it off, and confirmed with a firefighter that the solenoid in the wing audibly closed. The mechanic turned the electrical power off and disconnected the battery. The fuel leak from the right engine filter bowl stopped.It took the mechanic about 30 minutes to gather the equipment needed to defuel the airplane, and he decided to start with the right side by connecting to the engine supply line. He reconnected the battery and entered the cockpit to turn on the electrical power. With power on, the cockpit displays illuminated, and he heard the landing gear try to operate to the down position. After another mechanic pulled the circuit breaker for the avionics, he defueled the airplane.During recovery, the airplane was lifted off the ground, and the landing gear were successfully extended to the down and locked position.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot's inadvertently turning on the starter switches, which turned off the generators and resulted in a loss of electrical power and gear-up landing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the emergency procedures for a loss of electrical power or to manually extend the landing gear.""",Private,NTSB ,2015

While flying at low altitude the engine failed. The pilot carried out a forced landing at Sanamer. The aircraft ran over a fence and came to rest against a church.The airplane did not have a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of the accident.Conclusion (translated from Russian)The aircraft accident with the aircraft An-2s/x RA-56528 occurred due to the collision of the aircraft with an obstacle during the forced landing. The necessity of the forced landing was caused by the engine self-absorption during the flight, most probably due to the oil tank bloating and its wall pressing on the engine stop-crane lever on the carburetor.The increase in pressure in the oil tank and its bloating were the result of deposits of soot in the drainage pipe connecting the oil tank with the atmosphere. Contributing factors- Absence of the tank flushing, including the tank drainage pipeline with the atmosphere provided for by the periodic maintenance after 400±30 hours of flight or 12±1 month of operation;- Maintenance of aircraft by persons who do not have a certificate of a maintenance and repair specialist;- performance of the flight over the locality at an altitude that does not allow landing outside the locality in case of aircraft malfunction;- performance of the flight by an aircraft under the influence of alcoholic intoxication of the average degree.18-05-201518-05-201518-05-201518-05-201518-05-2015",Ferry/positioning,MAK ,2015

The captain, who was an instructor, sat in the right seat and the trainee in the left seat for training to obtain the type rating for First Officer certification in the Japan Coast Guard. The final part of the training was a  flap up landing at Sendai Airport, Japan. The captain and the trainee completed the flap up landing checklist just before the arrival at Yuriage (a visual reporting point of Sendai Airport) and the captain told the trainee that if the pitch angle (nose-up angle) exceeded 6°, corrective control would have to be performed by pushing the control column forward. Vref (reference speed for landing) was 126 kt. The aircraft entered the traffic pattern of runway 09 and landed around 1558.Although the trainee made the main landing gear touch down near the aiming point marking for the runway 09, he felt it took a great deal of time to lower the nose. This time the captain on the right seat pushed the control column forward since he feared a tail strike. Then the nose landing gear touched the ground with stronger impact than usual (+1.47 g). In. Both the captain and the trainee were not aware of irregularity of the aircraft in landing roll, therefore they continued taxi and the aircraft arrived at the apron at around 1605.After the engines were shutdown, the nose landing gear was found to be damaged in post-flight inspection by the on-board mechanic. Afterward, detailed inspection was conducted, which revealed abrasion marks on the lower part of the nose landing gear, damage on components of the nose landing gear, and deformation of the forward fuselage skins of the airframe.PROBABLE CAUSES ""In this accident, it is probable that the nose of the aircraft suddenly downed and the nose landing gear strongly touched down on the ground after the main landing gear touched the ground in the landing, therefore the components of the nose landing gear were damaged and the fuselage skins of the airframe was deformed.Regarding the fact that the nose landing gear of the aircraft strongly touched the ground on the ground, it is probable that it was because that the captain who considered worry of tail contact performed the sudden and large control for moving the nose downward, when the nose-up attitude tended to be too excessive after the nose landing gear touched the ground once and the nose upped again.""",Training,JTSB ,2015

The pilot, who was the sole occupant was not injured. The aircraft took off from Tokyo-Haneda Airport at 1441 local time on a ferry flight to Konan Airfield. The pilot switched from IFR to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) at about 15nm short of Kibi VOR. The aircraft passed over the vicinity of Saidaiji (the published visual reporting point, 6.7 nm northeast from the airfield) at an altitude of about 3,000 ft and a speed of about 200 kt at 1541, and acquired information on the active runway and wind condition from Konan Flight Service.This was reported as runway 09, with a wind direction 090° at 5 kts, and the aircraft was requested to report on the left downwind leg. The captain remembered the wind condition being 4 kts from the south, and assessed both runway directions to be available. He thus requested to land using runway 27, which was a shorter flight path, and was requested to report at 2 nm short of runway 27 or on the base leg.The aircraft was configured for landing and at 154459 the aircraft descended through 500 feet.The captain stated that he made straight-in approach at 117 kt, adding 10 kt as usual above the VREF displayed on the speed indicator to avoid stalling. According to EGPWS records, there was a warning ""Too Low, Flaps"" at 154511 when the aircraft was at 205 ft AGL, with an airspeed 155 kt and ground speed 160 kt. This voice warning was repeated two times.EGPWS records showed the aircraft gradually reduced speed on the final approach, with the last record being at 87 ft AGL with an airspeed 142 kt and ground speed 147 kt.The main landing gears of the aircraft touched down forward of the aiming point marking. About half way down the runway the pilot noticed a bird and turned a little bit to the right to avoid the bird, which was flying away. The captain then strongly applied the brakes, but he did not feel the usual deceleration. Continuing to apply the brakes, the aircraft avoided the stopway edge lights to the right and entered a grass area; accordingly, it went into a pond used as a regulating reservoir located west of the runway at about 20 to 30 kts. Konan Airport is former Okayama Airport (OKJ/RJOB) with a single runway 09/27 measuring 1200 m x 30 m (20 m grooving) and 0 ft elevation. After opening of new Okayama Airport in 1988, the airport was renamed as Konan Airport and is used for general aviation.PROBABLE CAUSESIn this accident, it is highly probable that the aircraft overran the runway, fell into the pond and sustained damage due to the excessive speed during landing and the delay in applying the brakes.Regarding the excessive speed of the aircraft at the landing and the delay of applying its brakes, it is somewhat likely that it contribute that the captain misunderstood the wind information, chose to land on the runway in tail wind condition and lost time margin; besides, he noticed a bird and was forced to its correspondence.10-06-2015",Ferry/positioning,JTSB ,2015

This was the operator's inaugural scheduled regular public transport service to Kosrae and Pohnpei.Travelling on-board were the Nauruan President, the Nauruan Minister of Aviation, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nauru Air Corporation. In the six weeks preceding this flight, the operator had flown three charter flights to the FSM airports. The captain also stated that he had flown a couple of charter flights (during the day) into Kosrae before this inaugural scheduled service.The flight was originally scheduled to leave Nauru at 0230 UTC (1430 Nauru Time). However, a technical issue with the original aircraft led to a change to VH-NLK. This resulted in the aircraft departing 60 minutes late. The sector from the Marshall Islands to Kosrae was delayed a further 17 minutes due to ground handling issues. The flight departed after last light at 0740 and the planned flight time was 1 hour 19 minutes. The approach and landing at Kosrae was at night.For this sector, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring.During the climb to the planned cruising altitude of FL360, in accordance with standard procedures, the flight crew selected the standard atmospheric pressure of 1013 hPa on the altimeters.The flight crew stated that, prior to commencing the descent for Kosrae, they obtained the weather and the local QNH. The weather had deteriorated from that forecast. The flight crew also stated that, during the descent and approach, the local flight information service radio operator provided a considerable number of weather updates on the local airport conditions at Kosrae. Visibility was around 3 NM, rain showers were in the area with low cloud and wind 'pretty much straight down the strip for (runway) 05'. The captain, as pilot flying, conducted the briefing for the non-directional beacon (NDB)/distance measuring equipment (DME) approach to runway 05. The captain stated that, at this time, they had made special mention of the unusually low transition level of FL 55. The captain stated that at most airports they operated into, the transition level was between FL 110 and FL 130. The crew then completed the descent checklist. They had decided that, based on the expected weather conditions, they would make two approach attempts, and if they could not land, would divert to Nauru Airport, the nominated alternate airport. Prior to descending below the transition level, the crew did not complete the approach checklist, which consisted of one item set the altimeters to the local QNH and crosscheck them. Leaving the altimeters' subscale set to the standard atmospheric pressure setting of 1013 hPa, and not setting the subscale to the local barometric pressure of 1007 hPa, resulted in the indicated altitude over-reading, such that when the altimeter indicated 500 ft, the aircraft's actual altitude was about 320 ft above the mean sea level.At about 0856, the aircraft passed overhead the NDB at 5,000 ft, and continued the descent, tracking outbound on a heading of 300°, to about 10 NM from the NDB (10 DME). The flight crew were controlling the aircraft through the auto-flight systems, with an autopilot and the autothrottle engaged. At this point, the crew turned the aircraft left, and at 0901, the aircraft intercepted the inbound track to the NDB at about 1,800 ft. The crew selected the landing gear down at 1,500 ft, and flap 15 at 1,250 ft.The crew stated that they established visual contact with the runway as the aircraft passed through 900 ft indicated altitude, about 5 NM from the DME. At about 740 ft indicated altitude, the crew selected flap 25. The crew elected to delay selection of the nominated landing flap of 40 degrees until they made positive visual contact with the runway. They did not subsequently select flap 40 on that approach.As the aircraft descended to the minimum descent altitude for the approach of 500 ft, the captain selected the altitude hold (ALT HOLD) mode to level the aircraft at 500 ft indicated altitude. At 090313, an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) alert sounded, and lasted for 5 seconds. The aircraft was over water, at 368 ft radio altitude. The crew reported that they were in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) at night, with the runway lights in sight. The crew stated that, at the time, they believed the EGPWS alert was due to a 'map shift' in the aircraft's navigation position. The flight crew selected 'terrain inhibit', which cancelled the current EGPWS TCF alert. The crew were not aware that the EGPWS had its own internal GPS.At 090319, the aircraft was at 4.31 DME, 480 ft indicated altitude and 340 ft radio altitude, and descending at about 313 fpm, when the EGPWS TCF alert again sounded, and lasted for 12 seconds. The aircraft maintained 480 ft indicated altitude for about 12 seconds, before descending again.The crew reported losing visual reference with the runway when the aircraft was about 3 NM from the DME. In response to losing visual reference, the captain disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and pressed the take-off/go-around (TOGA) switches on the thrust levers. At this time the recorded aircraft pitch angle was 9.5°. The flight data recorder data showed that TOGA was selected at 090347, at 448 ft indicated altitude, or 304 ft radio altitude, and the aircraft was about 3.5 NM from the DME. At this time, the aircraft's computed airspeed reduced to 129 kt.The captain stated that he pressed the TOGA switches on the thrust levers once. In the Flight Director engaged go-around mode, one TOGA switch press results in a reduced thrust autothrottle setting, and two presses of the TOGA switch advances the autothrottle to full go-around thrust. The crew stated that the aircraft pitch angle was initially raised to 15°, however, the captain observed the airspeed decay and pitched the aircraft down to increase the airspeed. The first officer stated he called 'sink rate' twice. The captain then realised and rectified the situation, depressing the TOGA switch a second time commanding full go-around thrust.At 090353, the aircraft was at 3.3 DME, and the third EGPWS TCF alert sounded, which lasted for 10 seconds. The aircraft was then at 384 ft indicated altitude, or 244 ft radio altitude, and descended 5 seconds later to its lowest radio altitude of 200 ft before climbing.At 090404, the flaps were retracted to 15° and the aircraft reached its maximum pitch up angle of 16°. Two seconds later, the flaps were retracted to 10°. From the time the captain set the thrust to TOGA until the aircraft was stabilised on the missed approach path (at about 0905), the recorded aircraft pitch angle varied from -0.35° to +16°.When the aircraft was established on the missed approach heading, the captain continued a climb to 4,000 ft. After stabilising the aircraft in the missed approach, the crew identified that the altimeters were still set to 1013 hPa and corrected them to the local area QNH. After repositioning overhead, the NDB at 4,000 ft, the crew then conducted a second approach and the aircraft landed at Kosrae without further incident.Contributing factors- The flight crew did not complete the approach checklist before commencing the non-precision NDB approach into Kosrae. As a result, the altimeters' barometric pressure settings remained at the standard setting of 1013 hPa instead of being set to the reported local barometric pressure of 1007 hPa. The flight crew descended the aircraft to the minimum descent altitude of 500 ft as indicated by the altimeters, however, due to the barometric pressure setting not being reset, the aircraft descended to a height significantly below 500 ft.- The crew descended the aircraft in IMC and at night below the approach profile for the Kosrae runway, resulting in EGPWS alerts. Terrain clearance assurance was eroded further by the flight crew not correcting the flight profile until the flight crew lost visual contact with the runway.- The flight crew's belief that the EGPWS warnings were due to a decreased navigational performance and not terrain proximity led to their decision to inhibit the first EGPWS warning and not correct the flight path.- Due to the captains fatigue and the increased workload and stress associated with the inaugural regular public transport flight into Kosrae at night in rapidly deteriorating weather, the crews decision making and task execution on the missed approach were affected.",International Scheduled Passenger,ATSB ,2015

The pilot and eight passengers were killed.The accident airplane was the third of four Promech-operated float-equipped airplanes that departed at approximate 5-minute intervals from a floating dock in Rudyerd Bay. The accident flight and the two Promech flights that departed before it were carrying cruise-ship passengers who had a 1230 ""all aboard"" time for their cruise ship that was scheduled to depart at 1300. The sightseeing tour flight, which the cruise ship passengers had purchased from the cruise line as a shore excursion, overflew remote inland fjords; coastal waterways; and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness.Promech pilots could choose between two standard tour routes between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan, referred to as the ""short route"" (which is about 52 nautical miles, takes about 25 minutes to complete, and is primarily over land) and the ""long route"" (which is about 63 nm, takes about 30 minutes to complete, and is primarily over seawater channels). Although the long route  was less scenic, it was generally preferred in poor weather conditions because it was primarily over water, which enabled the pilots to fly at lower altitudes beneath cloud layers. Route choice was at each pilot's discretion based on the pilot's assessment of the weather. The accident pilot and two other Promech pilots (one of whom was repositioning an empty airplane) chose the short route for the return leg, while the pilot of the second Promech flight to depart chose the long route. The accident flight encountered deteriorating weather conditions with terrain becoming obscured by overcast clouds with visibility restricted in rain and mist.Although the accident pilot had climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided safe terrain clearance had he followed the typical short route (which required the flight to pass two nearly identical mountains before turning west), the pilot instead deviated from that route and turned the airplane west early (after it passed only the first of the two mountains). The pilot's route deviation placed the airplane on a collision course with a 1,900-ft mountain, which it struck at an elevation of about 1,600 ft mean sea level. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up rapidly before colliding with terrain. The timing of this aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions, and, as soon as he realized that the flight was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in an ineffective attempt to avoid the terrain.The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was (1) the pilots decision to continue visual flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in his geographic disorientation and controlled flight into terrain; and (2) Promechs company culture, which tacitly endorsed flying in hazardous weather and failed to manage the risks associated with the competitive pressures affecting Ketchikan-area air tour operators; its lack of a formal safety program; and its inadequate operational control of flight releases.25-06-201525-06-201525-06-2015",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2015

Four passengers disembarked at Komandoo and 166 lb of luggage (3 suitcases from the cabin and 1 hand luggage from the aft baggage compartment) were offloaded from the aircraft. The passengers that disembarked at Komandoo were seated in the first and the second row of double seats.The second sector of the flight was Komandoo-Kuredu with an approximate flight duration of five minutes. The aircraft departed Komandoo at approximately 1725 and the co-pilot was Pilot Flying on this sector.The new take-off mass of the aircraft for departure at Komandoo, in accordance with the flight release, was 11,240 lb. 11 passengers (5 female, 4 male and 2 child), 613 lb of luggage and 435 lb of fuel remaining on board. The take-off at Komandoo was normal as per the crew members. Once airborne, the copilot briefed the captain on the approach and landing area selection. The co-pilot stated that she was taking a North West bound line with Kuredu on the right side of the aircraft. The descent checks were completed shortly after and the aircraft joined the pattern on left downwind. The co-pilot initially requested for 10 degrees of flap followed by 20 degrees of flap on base, with speeds reducing to 75-80 knots. The crew did not recall any anomalies throughout this portion of the flight.In preparation for the landing, on final approach, the co-pilot requested the flaps at the fully down position and propeller levers forward. Immediately after the selection of flaps, the nose of the aircraft started to rise and the aircraft started to vibrate. The co-pilot stated that she was no longer able to control the aircraft at this stage and transferred the controls to the PIC.When the captain took over the controls, the aircraft was passing at approximately 300 ft, in a pitch up attitude. The captain stated he saw the stall warning light on and the aircraft was in a right bank going into a spin at this stage.The captain then applied full left rudder, moved the control column forward and put the power levers to idle. The nose of the aircraft however continued to rise. The captain then moved the flaps to the fully up position. The captain reported gaining a small degree of control at this stage but the aircraft impacted the sea before he could regain full control of the aircraft.On initial impact the left float detached. The aircraft then bounced and landed on the right float causing the right float to also detach from the aircraft. The right float was, however, trapped between the airframe and the engine for several minutes.Once the aircraft settled down, the captain gave the command for evacuation. The co-pilot and the cabin crew coordinated the evacuation and all the passengers and crew were able to escape through the left passenger door before the aircraft submerged completely. The captain was the last to leave the aircraft, after making sure that all passengers and other crew had evacuated the aircraft and that everybody had life jackets.With both floats detached from the aircraft and the right float still trapped, the aircraft stayed afloat until all passengers and crew escaped. At the same time, the aircraft started tilting left causing water to rush inside and started sinking. The aircraft continued sinking, banking left, flipped over then sank to the bottom of the sea.

The underside of the aft fuselage and drain mast were damaged.The co-pilot was the Pilot Flying for the flight to Glasgow. The en route of the flight was uneventful. The pilots reported that the approach briefing was carried out before the top of descent and that it included a review of the greater potential for a tailstrike on the A321. The descent and approach for runway 23 also proceeded uneventfully, with the aircraft being vectored for a CAT 1 ILS approach in visual flight conditions. At 1,000 ft aal the aircraft was fully configured for landing, stable, with flap full and the autopilot engaged. The VLS (lowest selectable speed), based on the weight data for the aircraft, was 140 kt and the corresponding VAPP (approach speed) was 145 kt.The co-pilot took control, disconnected the autopilot and flew the final approach manually with the autothrust engaged. At 50 ft agl the flare was initiated, using a progressive aft sidestick input, and at 25 ft agl the thrust levers were closed. Sensing that the pitch attitude had not increased enough and that the flare was a bit ""flat"", the co-pilot continued to pull further back on the sidestick.After touchdown the operator's SOP requires the commander, as the Pilot Monitoring, to select reverse thrust. He reported that, on touchdown, he looked down to locate the thrust levers, prior to making the selection, and this may have diverted his attention from monitoring the landing attitude.The recorded data showed an initial touchdown at 138 kt, with a pitch attitude of 7.4° and a normal acceleration of 1.5 g; the ground spoilers deployed. The aft sidestick input was reduced but a net nose-up pitch command was maintained. The aircraft lifted off the ground for a short time before making a second touchdown, recorded at a pitch attitude of 9.5° and normal acceleration of 1.7g. The operator's SOP requires the PM to announce 'pitch' if the nose-up pitch attitude exceeds 7.5°. At some stage the commander said 'ok push the nose down' but it was too late to prevent the tailstrike. Reverse thrust was selected 4 seconds after the second touchdown.The co-pilot reported that the touchdown seemed heavier than normal and the pitch attitude rather high but, because no 'pitch' callout was heard, the co-pilot was not overly concerned.Neither pilot perceived that the aircraft had bounced or that a tailstrike might have occurred. The landing was completed and the aircraft was taxied clear of the runway and onto a parking stand.After the aircraft parked on stand, a post-flight report (PFR) printout was generated. The commander checked it and noted that there had been a pitch exceedence on landing.Several of the cabin crew had noticed an unusual noise during the landing and the senior cabin crew member reported this to the commander. A ground maintenance engineer then came on board and advised the commander that there was damage to the aircraft. They both disembarked to carry out an inspection and observed scrape marks on the aft lower fuselage area and the aft galley drain mast.ConclusionsThe technical and training measures put in place by the manufacturer have been effective in reducing the tailstrike rate on the global fleet over the last ten years.It is difficult to pinpoint a precise reason why this tailstrike occurred. As described in the manufacturers bulletins, it is likely to have been the result of a combination of factors. These include an airspeed which had reduced below the target towards VLS, and an initial tentative but progressive flare input which did not sufficiently alter the flightpath of the aircraft. Although the initial touchdown was at a high pitch attitude, probably the most significant contributor to the tailstrike was the continued aft sidestick input after touchdown, which resulted in the pitch attitude continuing to increase.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2015

Both pilots were not injured.According to the captain, the pilots were ""rushed"" as they performed their preflight preparations of the jet and forgot to close the baggage door. Ground personnel noticed the discrepancy and drove an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) out to the airplane so that they could advise the crew. After dismounting from the ATV, which they had parked about 10 ft in front of the airplane's left wing, they warned the captain, who left the cockpit to close the baggage door.Once the door was closed, he returned to the cockpit. The captain then looked out the side window and noticed that the airplane was rolling forward, and he asked the first officer what she was doing. About that time, the airplane struck the ATV. The flight crew stated that once they realized the airplane was moving, they attempted to apply the brakes, but it was not untilthey shut down the engines and re-applied the parking brake that the airplane came to a stop. A postaccident functional check of the airplane's hydraulic and braking systems did not reveal any anomalies.Review of the airplane's cockpit voice recorder revealed that the crew did not verbally follow the airplane's before start checklist, which required them to verify hydraulic system pressure, and that the parking brake was set before starting the engines. Had the flight crew followed this procedure, monitored the airplane's motion during and immediately after the engine start, and been more cognizant of the objects surrounding the airplane, it is likely that the ground collision would have been avoided.The pilot in command stated that the aircraft suffered from a 'plethora of electrical issues' since it was put back into service after being inactive for two years.Additionally, on the first flight attempt after repairs, it was noted that the parking brake when set, did not illuminate the light.

There, he made a check of the amphibious controls in the water.After the taxi, the aircraft was aligned in a southeast direction and started the take-off run.Soon after it left the water, the pilot lost control of the aircraft. As a result of the low height, there was a touch of the left wing with the river surface, which caused the aircraft to swerve and impact the water abruptly.The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the pilot and passenger were unharmed.Contributing Factors-application of commands -undetermined.It is possible that the pilot's inappropriate use of the flight controls during take-off, with the aircraft prematurely pulling out of the water and a low speed may have caused the aircraft to stall on the left wing, with the consequent loss of height and collision of the aircraft against the water.-Piloting Judgment -undetermined.It is possible that a misjudgement of the time to pull the aircraft out of the water so that it gained speed a few meters high may have led to a critical situation, causing the stall on the left wing.-Decision-making process-undetermined.Given the circumstances present in the context and the characteristics of the operation, it is possible that the pilot may have encountered difficulties in correctly assessing the adequacy of the flight parameters required for take-off. In that case, the hasty decision to remove the aircraft from the water would favour the occurrence of stalling of the aircraft.",Test,CENIPA ,2015

The copilot was Pilot Flying, while the captain was Pilot Monitoring.It was raining as the flight approached Yangon with Cumulonimbus clouds at 1500 feet over the airport. When 4 km out, the flight was given landing clearance by ATC ""Air Bagan 424, wind calm, runway 21, clear to land, caution landing runway wet, after landed vacate via Charlie.""At decision height (250ft), runway 21 was in sight and runway lightings were seen. The aircraft continued though there was light rain. At about 50 ft, visibility suddenly became poor due to heavy rainfall. So the captain took over control of the aircraft. A few seconds later the aircraft made a hard landing, skidded and veered off the left side of the runway onto muddy ground. It came torest about 2800ft from the threshold and 75ft from the runway edge.The copilot radioed a distress message, but did not use standard phraseology. The ATC controller did not appear to understand the message and was not able to give definite information and instruction to the Airport Fire Station to respond to the emergency. Therefore, the aircraft rescue and fire fighters reached the accident site after about 8 minutes.Primary CauseDuring the final landing phase, the pilot was reluctant to perform a go-around while the plane was unstable and of bounce landing in low visibility condition.Contributing Factorsa) The visibility was very low and the runway centerline lightings were not able to be seen intermittently.b) The runway was wet and it was raining heavily.c) The pilot in command took over the control of the plane from the copilot (14) seconds just before the first impact.24-07-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAIB ,2015

The aircraft operated on a flight from Milan-Malpensa Airport, Italy to Blackbushe, U.K.After descending through the London Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) it was handed over from London Control to Farnborough Approach. Its descent continued towards Blackbushe and, having reported that he had the airfield in sight, the pilot was instructed to descend at his own discretion. When the aircraft was approximately four miles south of its destination, he was instructed to contact Blackbushe Information.The weather at Blackbushe was fine with light and variable winds, visibility in excess of ten kilometres, and no low cloud.HZ-IBN entered the left-hand circuit for runway 25 via the crosswind leg. Towards the end of the downwind leg, it overtook an Ikarus C42 microlight aircraft, climbing to pass ahead of and above that aircraft. As the climb began, at approximately 1,000 ft aal, the TCAS of HZ-IBN generated a 'descend' RA alert to resolve a conflict with the microlight. The TCAS RA changed to 'maintain vertical speed' and then 'adjust vertical speed', possibly to resolve a second conflict with a light aircraft which was above HZ-IBN and to the east of the aerodrome. Neither the microlight nor the light aircraft was equipped with TCAS.Following this climb, HZ-IBN then flew a curving base leg, descending at up to 3,000 feet per minute towards the threshold of runway 25. The aircrafts TCAS annunciated 'clear of conflict' when HZ-IBN was 1.1 nm from the runway threshold, at 1,200 ft aal, and at a speed of 146 KIAS, with the landing gear down and flap 3 selected.The aircraft continued its approach at approximately 150 KIAS. Between 1,200 and 500 ft aal the rate of descent averaged approximately 3,000 fpm, and at 500 ft aal the descent rate was 2,500 fpm. The aircrafts TAWS generated six 'pull up' warnings on final approach. The aircraft crossed the runway 25 threshold at approximately 50 ft aal at 151 KIAS. The aircraft manufacturer calculated that the appropriate target threshold speed for the aircraft's mass and configuration was 108 KIAS. The AFISO initiated a full emergency as the aircraft touched down, because ""it was clear at this time that the aircraft was not going to stop"".Tyre marks made by the aircraft at touchdown indicated that it landed 710 m beyond the runway 25 threshold. The runway 25 declared Landing Distance Available (LDA) was 1,059 m; therefore the aircraft touched down 349 m before the end of the declared LDA. The paved runway surface extended 89 m beyond the end of the LDA.The aircraft continued along the runway, decelerating, but departed the end of the paved surface at a groundspeed of 83 kt (84 KIAS airspeed) and struck an earth bank, which caused the aircraft to become airborne again. It then struck cars in a car park, part of a large commercial site adjacent to the aerodrome. The wing separated from the fuselage, and the fuselage rolled left through 350° before coming to rest on top of the detached wing. A fire broke out in the underside of the aft fuselage and burned with increasing intensity.The aerodrome's fire services responded to the crash alarm but their path to the accident site was blocked by a locked gate between the aerodrome and commercial site. The first two vehicles arrived at the gate 1 minute and 34 seconds after the aircraft left the runway end.The third vehicle, which carried a key for the gate, arrived approximately one minute later, and the three vehicles proceeded through the gate 2 minutes and 46 seconds after the aircraft left the runway. As the aircraft was located in an area of the car park surrounded by a 2.4 m tall wire mesh fence, the vehicles had to drive approximately 400 m to gain access to the accident site. Despite applying all their available media, the fire service was unable to bring the fire under control. The intensity of the fire meant that it was not possible to approach the aircraft to save life.All four occupants of the aircraft survived the impact and subsequently died from the effects of fire.Among the passengers were the stepmother and sister of Osama bin Laden.CONCLUSION ""Towards the end of the flight, a number of factors came together to create a very high workload situation for the pilot, to the extent that his mental capacity could have become saturated. His ability to take on new and critical information, and adapt his situational awareness, would have been impeded. In conjunction with audio overload and the mental stressors this can invoke, this may have lead him to become fixated on continuing the approach towards a short runway""31-07-201531-07-201531-07-2015",Private,AAIB ,2015

The take-off run was short - approximately 100 m, according to a witness - under the conditions of a gusty wind from the easterly direction. During the initial climb, at a height of about 15-20 m, the aircraft began to lean to the left and descend slightly. During this turn in descent, bank angle continued to increase, the aircraft flying with the left wing at very low height above the aircraft parked towards the northern end of the airstrip. Observing that the pilot was not taking any avoiding action, the technician tried instinctively to turn the control yoke to the right. According to his statement the yoke was blocked.With the engine still running in take-off mode, the aircraft continued to descend, and after passing the parked aircraft, it hit the ground with the propeller and the left wing tip.

There was no EGPWS warning nor any other EGPWS callout during the descent. The Oksibil Airport was not provided with the high-resolution terrain data in the database version installed on the accident aircraft's EGPWS.Additionaly, some pilots within the air operator had experiences that the EGPWS warning became active in a condition that according to the pilots, the warning is not appropriate. These experiences led to the pilot behaviour of pulling the EGPWS circuit breaker to eliminate nuisance of EGPWS warning that considered unnecessary.The investigators could not determine the actual EGPWS CB position during the accident flight.Contributing Factors1. The deviation from the visual approach guidance in visual flight rules without considering the weather and terrain condition, with no or limited visual reference to the terrain resulted in the aircraft flew to terrain.2.

This decision was primarily based on personnel availability, as well as the knowledge that the company had landed at Margaree in the A100 on two previous occasions and that, with the expected landing weight, the calculated landing distance would be 1700 feet, 800 feet shorter than the runway.The operations manager assigned a part-time employed pilot to be the captain and a full-time employed pilot to be the first officer (FO). Although these pilots had flown together before, neither had previously flown into Margaree.In preparation for the flight, the operations manager and the captain discussed hazards that the crew should be aware of, primarily the possibility that people or animals could be on the runway, and that, if required, a diversion to Port Hawkesbury Airport (CYPD) was an option. The operations manager expected the captain to make the decision as to whether a safe landing could be carried out.Neither the captain nor the FO indicated that he had any concerns about undertaking the flight. The crew discussed landing on runway 01 and noted that it was shorter than the runways that they had typically flown into. The crew agreed that the final approach would be carried out at 120 knots and that they wanted to touch down as close as possible to the threshold. Due to high terrain near Margaree, the crew planned to stay high and descend at a steeper rate during final approach.Prior to departure, even though this was the first flight of the day for the aircraft, the crew did not perform the required Engine Run-up checklist.At 1529, the aircraft departed Halifax Stanfield International Airport under visual flight rules (VFR). The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and occupied the left seat, and the FO was the pilot not flying (PNF).At 1551, a descent from the enroute altitude of 9500 feet above sea level (ASL) was initiated.The crew re-confirmed that, based on the wind reported by the automated weather observation system at Port Hawkesbury Airport, they would land on runway 01.At 1600, the PNF made an advisory transmission on the aerodrome traffic frequency (ATF) informing any traffic in the area that the aircraft would be joining a left base leg for runway 01.At 1604, the crew performed the Descent Checks checklist in accordance with the company standard operating procedures (SOP), with the exception of the approach briefing, which was abbreviated and described the approach as being visual for runway 01.At 1607, the PNF reported on the ATF that the aircraft was at 2700 feet ASL and about 20 nautical miles (nm) from Margaree. No other aircraft reported being in the area.When the aircraft was at 2500 feet ASL, the PNF made an advisory transmission on the ATF indicating that the aircraft was joining the circuit on a left base for runway 01.At 1613, about 5 nm from the runway, the power was reduced to 600 foot-pounds of torque, and approach flaps were selected to initiate a steep rate of descent.The crew observed a tower along the flight path, and the PNF focused his attention on ensuring that clearance was maintained.At about 1614, the PF reduced the power to idle to further increase the rate of descent. The engine auto-ignition system igniters activated, indicating that engine power was below 400 foot-pounds of torque. The igniters remained on until the aircraft touched down.The landing gear was selected down and, once the PNF had confirmed that the aircraft was clear of the tower, full flaps were selected. The crew did not complete the Landing Checks checklist as required by the SOPs. About 20 seconds later, the aircraft was descending through 1900 feet ASL (about 1700 feet above runway elevation) and 2.1 nm from the runway threshold.At about 161534, the PNF indicated that the airspeed was below the planned speed. The PF indicated that he was making the appropriate correction and began to increase the airspeed by pitching the aircraft down; there was no change in engine power. This correction was followed by automated calls of ""SINK RATE,"" ""PULL UP, PULL UP,"" and ""FIVE HUNDRED"" (indicating 500 feet above ground elevation) in very quick succession from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). The PF acknowledged the TAWS calls and began to reduce the rate of descent by pitching the aircraft up; there was no change in engine power.At 161556, when the aircraft was about 120 feet above the runway elevation, the PNF began to move the propellers toward full while asking the PF if the propellers should be advanced. Almost immediately, the PF acknowledged the PNF's statement by replying ""check."" There was no change in engine power, and the aircraft's rate of descent increased.At 161606, the propellers reached the full position; 4 seconds later, the PF requested that the propellers be selected to full. Almost immediately following this, the aircraft touched down hard in a flat attitude about 263 feet beyond the runway threshold. The right main landing gear (MLG) collapsed, and 82 feet further down the runway, the right propeller contacted the runway. The aircraft settled onto its right wing and engine nacelle, and subsequently veered to the right and departed the runway. The aircraft came to rest about 1850 feet from the threshold and 22 feet from the runway edge, on a heading of approximately 090°.There were no injuries and there was no post-impact fire. The crew and passengers evacuated the aircraft through the cabin door.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Neither pilot had considered that landing on a short runway at an unfamiliar aerodrome with known high terrain nearby and joining the circuit directly on a left base were hazards that may create additional risks, all of which would increase the crew's workload.2. The presence of the tower resulted in the pilot not flying focusing his attention on monitoring the aircraft's location, rather than on monitoring the flight or the actions of the pilot flying.3. The crew's increased workload, together with the unexpected distraction of the presence of the tower, led to a reduced situational awareness that caused them to omit the Landing Checks checklist.4. At no time during the final descent was the engine power increased above about 400 foot-pounds of torque.5. Using only pitch to control the rate of descent prevented the pilot flying from precisely controlling the approach, which would have ensured that the flare occurred at the right point and at the right speed.6. Neither pilot recognized that the steep rate of descent was indicative of an unstable approach.7. Advancing the propellers to full would have increased the drag and further increased the rate of descent, exacerbating the already unstable approach.8. The aircraft crossed the runway threshold with insufficient energy to arrest the rate of descent in the landing flare, resulting in a hard landing that caused the right main landing gear to collapse.Findings as to risk1. If data recordings are not available to an investigation, then the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety may be precluded.2. If organizations do not use modern safety management practices, then there is an increased risk that hazards will not be identified and risks will not be mitigated.3. If passenger seats installed in light aircraft are not equipped with shoulder harnesses, then there is an increased risk of passenger injury or death in the event of an accident.4. If the experience and proficiency of pilots are not factored into crew selection, then there is a risk of suboptimal crew pairing, resulting in a reduction of safety margins.5. If pilots do not carry out checklists in accordance with the company's and manufacturer's instructions, then there is a risk that a critical item may be missed, which could jeopardize the safety of the flight.6. If crew resource management is not used and continuously fostered, then there is a risk that pilots will be unprepared to avoid or mitigate crew errors encountered during flight.7. If organizations do not have a clearly defined go-around policy, then there is a risk that flight crews will continue an unstable approach, increasing the risk of an approach-and-landing accident.8. If pilots are not prepared to conduct a go-around on every approach, then there is a risk that they may not respond to situations that require a go-around.9. If operators do not have a stable approach policy, then there is a risk that an unstable approach will be continued to a landing, increasing the risk of an approach-and-landing accident.10. If an organization's safety culture does not fully promote the goals of a safety management system, then it is unlikely that it will be effective in reducing risk.Other findings1. There were insufficient forward impact forces to automatically activate the emergency locator transmitter.16-08-201516-08-2015",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2015

The pilot and two passengers sustained minor injuries.  The flight originated from Wittman Regional Airport (OSH), Wisconsin, USA, about 1220.According to the pilot, the approach to runway 26 ""required a steeper than normal approach,"" because of trees near the runway. The airplane touched down near the displaced threshold and he applied the brakes to decelerate; however, the ""first pedal push was soft,"" which was ""not unusual."" Then, he continued ""pumping the brakes"" and considered a go-around; however, the remaining runway was too short. The pilot continued to ""pump"" the brakes, about six times; however, he did not think the brakes were operating. The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a berm, and came to rest upright approximately 200 feet beyond the end of the runway.During the accident sequence, the right main landing gear punctured the underside of the right wing, which resulted in substantial damage. In addition, the nose landing gear separated from the airplane.According to data downloaded from the airplanes diagnostic storage unit (DSU), the airplane touched down 1,280 ft beyond the runway threshold, which resulted in 2,408 ft of runway remaining (the runway had a displaced threshold of 737 ft) and that it traveled 2,600 ft before coming to rest about 200 ft past the runway. Comparing DSU data from previous downloaded flights revealed that the airplanes calculated deceleration rate during the accident landing was indicative of braking performance as well as or better than the previous landings. Estimated landing distance calculations revealed that the airplane required about 3,063 ft when crossing the threshold at 50 ft above ground level. However, the airplane touched down with only 2,408 ft of remaining runway, which resulted in the runway overrun.Probable Cause The pilot's failure to attain the proper touchdown point, which resulted in a runway overrun.",Private,NTSB ,2015

Thunderstorms had recently passed over the airport and the ground surfaces were wet. During the takeoff roll, the crew observed a flock of birds heading towards the runway. Seeing a conflict and concerned about the risk of collision, the aircraft commander directed the pilot flying to abort the takeoff. During the abort procedure, when the pilot flying selected full reverse on all four propellers, both propellers on the left side of the aircraft went into full reverse; however both propellers on the right side of the aircraft continued to produce some forward thrust. The crew was not successful at keeping the aircraft on the runway and it departed off the left side of the runway approximately 1000 feet before the end. The propellers contacted a Runway Distance Marker and a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) light. The aircraft plowed through the soft earth and the nose gear collapsed, causing the inside propeller on the right side of the aircraft to strike the ground and break away from the engine. All personnel on board exited the aircraft safely and only minor injuries were incurred.CAUSE FACTORSACTIVE CAUSE FACTORS1. The LRPC delayed calling ""Rotate,"" and called ""Malfunction"" after VRO. 2. At approximately 133 KIAS, the LRPFO rapidly retarded the throttles from a high power setting straight into the ground (BETA) range without checking the status of the BETA lights during the movement of the power levers further aft towards ground range/reverse. 3. No. 3 and 4 engines and propellers were not secured using the EHandles when the asymmetric thrust situation occurred. LATENT CAUSE FACTORS4. The PF is not required to monitor or check critical airspeeds above 80 KIAS. 5. The CP140 Takeoff Abort Procedure does not include direction as to what to do when the power levers are moved into the BETA range, and the associated BETA light does not illuminate. 6. The CP140 Takeoff Abort Procedure does not provide direction as to what to do if the AC decides that the fault does not dictate an abort. 7. The CP140 Takeoff Procedure dictates the initiation of the Takeoff Abort Procedure for any malfunction prior to refusal speed, regardless of the severity, and with no consideration to the speed regime. 8. The standing water on the runway caused reverted rubber hydroplaning and was a contributing factor to the aircraft leaving the hard surface. 9. The LRPC was likely mentally fatigued at the time of the accident, which may have adversely affected his decision making during the takeoff.",Military,Canada DFS ,2015

The Twin Otter took off from Naha, Okinawa at 0838 hours with 14 people onboard. The copilot was Pilot Flying. After a short flight, an approach was flown to runway 19 at Aguni Airport. After touchdown it veered to the right, went off the runway and impacted a fence and trees. The right main landing gear was twisted, and the nose section of the fuselage and the propeller of the No.2 engine were also damaged, but there was no fire. Eleven occupants were injured. It appeared that the nosewheel centering lock had disengaged during the flight, which went unnoticed by the crew.This particular plane was delivered to DAK on 31 March 2015, and was in service on 2 August 2015. DAK has another DHC-6-400, JA202D. Aguni Airport has a single runway 01/19 with 800 m x 25 m dimension. The weather data of Aguni Airport at the time of the accident by AMeDAS data 0900JST, wind southeast 3.5 m/s (7 kt), no precipitation, temperature 27.3 degree-Celsius.Probable CausesIt is highly probable that this accident occurred because, when the Aircraft landed, the PF could not properly control the aircraft that had started to deflect after touchdown, as a result of which it departed from the side of the runway and collided with the Perimeter Fence, and the aircraft was damaged.It is probable that the Aircraft started to deflect after touchdown because the PF forgot the checklist and the PIC as PM did not properly monitor or did not perform the necessary pointed out, as a result of which the Aircraft touched down with the nose wheel deflected to the right.It is somewhat likely that the PF could not properly control the Aircraft that had started to deflect after touchdown because he did not have sufficient knowledge concerning the aircraft system of the Aircraft, as a result of which he could not fully understand the situation when the deflection started. It is somewhat likely that the inadequate response of the PIC in the event of an unforeseen situation contributed to this.It is probable that PF had insufficient knowledge and could not fully understand the situation when the deflection started, because the Company had not properly confirmed the effectiveness of ground school training that should be held prior to route training and training on the establishment of knowledge.28-08-201528-08-201528-08-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,JTSB ,2015

On board were a French patient and two crew members as well as a mechanic, a doctor and two nurses. The aircraft departed Ouagadougou at 1636 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL340. The flight contacted the controller at Bamako Center at 1713, asking if FL380 was available because of the presence of clouds ahead. The controller then cleared the flight to FL380. After negotiating several other options to avoid severe turbulence, the crew decided to remain at FL340. At 1800 the flight was allowed to deviate 10 NM from the route to avoid an area of bad weather. Last radio contact with the flight was at 1804. At that time the aircraft was proceeding westward on Airway UA601 at a cleared altitude of FL340.At the same time Ceiba International flight CEL71 was heading eastward on Airway UA601 at a cleared altitude of FL350.The Boeing 737-8FB, registration 3C-LLY, had departed Dakar at 1728 hours and was en route to Cotonou, Benin and Malabo, Ecuatorial Guinea. The aircraft crossed paths with the BAe-125 at 1812, between points DEMOL and GATIL. At 1815 CEL71 contacted the controller at Dakar Center, stating they had observed descending traffic from the opposite direction, passing their altitude just behind them. Initially the crew referred to the event as a 'near miss collision'. The Dakar Center controller then attempted to contact the BAe-125, but there was no response.At 1816 CEL71 contacted  Dakar Center again, stating that the traffic in question likely touched their wing. The crew reported that they did not have any control issues. It was decided not land at Cotonou and continue to the final destination Malabo. After landing it appeared that the top part of the right hand winglet, measuring one metre, had broken off. Despite several attempts, no contact was made with the BAe-125. At 1822 the BAe-125 appeared on radar at Dakar, showing an altitude of FL350. The aircraft continued on the planned flight track. It passed Dakar, heading over sea. At 1907 the aircraft began to descend. At FL330 the aircraft turned right and immediately left, passing FL126 level before it disappeared from radar about 59 NM from Dakar. The aircraft was not found.The investigation learned that 6V-AIM had a history of level bust incidents in the months leading up to the accident. On three separate flights the aircraft had been flown in RVSM airspace at altitudes for which it had not been cleared. In one case opposite traffic, an Arik Air Boeing 737, had to be given descent instructions in order to avoid a lack of clearance.Additionally, on the day of the accident, the flight crew received instructions to correct their altitude on two occasions.PROBABLE CAUSE (transated from French)The collision is due to 6V-AIM's non-compliance with its flight level.

Altimetry problemsThese problems may have contributed to the collision. The indications of the two primary altimeters were different; The altimeter indications of the pilot in charge of communications and the altitude data transmitted by the transponder were different by about one thousand (1000) feet.On 23/07/2015, the aircraft was detected at level 310 instead of the 320 assigned by the ATC controller and indicated by the altimeter.On 31/08/15, 6V-AIM was coordinated by Roberts SESEL Point at 20H55 and FL 360. Once in radar contact, it was detected at FL 350 without any revision or authorization. After being questioned, he started to climb.On 05/09/2015, on the outward flight (DKR - OUA), the aircraft had triggered two CLAM alarms- Assigned flight level 330 and level acquired by autopilot 311- Assigned flight level 330 and level acquired by autopilot 3332.

On board were a French patient and two crew members as well as a mechanic, a doctor and two nurses. The aircraft departed Ouagadougou at 1636 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL340. The flight contacted the controller at Bamako Center at 1713, asking if FL380 was available because of the presence of clouds ahead. The controller then cleared the flight to FL380. After negotiating several other options to avoid severe turbulence, the crew decided to remain at FL340. At 1800 the flight was allowed to deviate 10 NM from the route to avoid an area of bad weather. Last radio contact with the flight was at 1804. At that time the aircraft was proceeding westward on Airway UA601 at a cleared altitude of FL340.At the same time Ceiba International flight CEL71 was heading eastward on Airway UA601 at a cleared altitude of FL350.The Boeing 737-8FB, registration 3C-LLY, had departed Dakar at 1728 hours and was en route to Cotonou, Benin and Malabo, Ecuatorial Guinea. The aircraft crossed paths with the BAe-125 at 1812, between points DEMOL and GATIL. At 1815 CEL71 contacted the controller at Dakar Center, stating they had observed descending traffic from the opposite direction, passing their altitude just behind them. Initially the crew referred to the event as a 'near miss collision'. The Dakar Center controller then attempted to contact the BAe-125, but there was no response.At 1816 CEL71 contacted  Dakar Center again, stating that the traffic in question likely touched their wing. The crew reported that they did not have any control issues. It was decided not land at Cotonou and continue to the final destination Malabo. After landing it appeared that the top part of the right hand winglet, measuring one metre, had broken off. Despite several attempts, no contact was made with the BAe-125. At 1822 the BAe-125 appeared on radar at Dakar, showing an altitude of FL350. The aircraft continued on the planned flight track. It passed Dakar, heading over sea. At 1907 the aircraft began to descend. At FL330 the aircraft turned right and immediately left, passing FL126 level before it disappeared from radar about 59 NM from Dakar. The aircraft was not found.The investigation learned that 6V-AIM had a history of level bust incidents in the months leading up to the accident. On three separate flights the aircraft had been flown in RVSM airspace at altitudes for which it had not been cleared. In one case opposite traffic, an Arik Air Boeing 737, had to be given descent instructions in order to avoid a lack of clearance.Additionally, on the day of the accident, the flight crew received instructions to correct their altitude on two occasions.PROBABLE CAUSE (transated from French)The collision is due to 6V-AIM's non-compliance with its flight level.

The pilot and two passengers sustained serious injuries. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local business flight. According to the pilot, the airplane was on the final leg of the traffic pattern when he reduced the power levers in order to descend further for landing, and he noticed that the right engine sounded like ""the [propeller] was heading towards beta."" The pilot increased the engine power and the sound ""went away."" Closer to the runway, he decreased engine power and the noise was heard again, the airplane yawed to the right, and he applied left aileron and rudder inputs in order to remain on the runway centerline. Over the runway, the pilot reduced the engine power to idle and the airplane ""pushed hard to the right."" Then, the pilot applied full power in an attempt to perform a go-around maneuver; however, the airplane yawed about 30 degrees off the runway centerline, the airplane touched down in the grass, and impacted trees prior to coming to rest.During the accident sequence, the wings and fuselage were substantially damaged.A postaccident examination of the maintenance logs indicated that an overhauled propeller was installed on the right engine and a test flight was performed on September 4, 2015, which was 8.7 flight hours prior to the accident.PROBABLE CAUSE "" The propeller's movement to the beta position during landing for reasons that could not be determined during postaccident examination and testing, which resulted in an attempted go-around and subsequent loss of airplane control.""06-09-201506-09-201506-09-201506-09-2015",Executive,NTSB ,2015

The flight left the gate at 1600 and taxied to runway 7L for departure. About 1612, the captain lined up for takeoff and advanced the engines to takeoff flex power. The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring (PM).  The relief first officer (RFO) was sitting in the cockpit jumpseat. During the takeoff roll they heard a ""bang"" or ""thud"" sound just before the airplane reached 80 knots (kts), and the airplane veered to the left. The captain announced he was stopping, retarded the thrust levers to idle, and began applying wheel brakes.As they were braking, the FO noticed the thrust levers began moving forward, and he disconnected the autothrottle (AT). As the airplane came to a stop the captain noticed the left (No. 1) engine exhaust gas temperature (EGT) indication turned red and the left engine fire indication came on, accompanied by an audible fire bell. The captain set the parking brake and called for the FIRE ENG LEFT checklist, and the FO performed the checklist memory items. As part of the memory items, the FO moved the left fuel control switch to fuel cutoff, pulled the left engine fire switch, and rotated the left fire switch to the stop to discharge the first fire bottle. The second fire bottle was discharged 15 seconds later.The RFO asked the captain if he should make an announcement to the passengers, and the captain approved. The RFO used the public address (PA) system to announce that passengers and cabin crew should remain seated. The RFO then noticed the shadow of a large cloud rising above the shadow of the fuselage, and he asked the captain if he should go into the cabin to investigate.The captain again approved. The RFO left the flight deck and met a cabin crewmember at door 2L, who said she had been trying to call the flight deck. The RFO observed black smoke, an orange glow, and a cabin window glass becoming ""crazed."" He told a cabin crewmember to get ready to evacuate and returned to the flight deck.While the RFO was in the cabin assessing the situation, the FO started the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) in accordance with the follow up reference items on the engine fire checklist. When the RFO returned to the flight deck he reported they needed to get off the airplane immediately. The captain commanded the FO to call the tower, then utilized the PA (public address) system to order an evacuation, and activated the evacuation alarm.The captain stated he attempted to run his portion of the evacuation checklist from memory and he missed the second step of ensuring both engines were turned off.The FO, who was referring to his portion of the QRH evacuation checklist, stated he spent between 15 to 20 seconds attempting to open the outflow valves (OFV) to depressurize the airplane for the evacuation, utilizing their respective switches on the cockpit overhead panel. However, recorded information showed the OFV selection switches remained in the automatic position. According to cockpit voice recorder information, a sound similar to the engine fire switches were pulled about 161320, followed about 2 seconds later by a sound, similar to the fire switch handle, being rotated. The other engine fire bottle was discharged about 3 seconds later, as called for in the evacuation checklist.The RFO noticed the right engine EICAS showed that the right (No. 2) engine was still operating.He pointed this out to the FO, who then moved the right engine fuel control switch to the fuel cutoff position. The FO stated he then also pulled the right engine fire switch. According to data obtained from the flight recorders, the right engine had remained operating for approximately 44 seconds after the captain gave the evacuation command.About the same time as the right engine was shutdown, the forward cargo bay fire warning light illuminated and the fire bell sounded in the cockpit. The captain armed the cargo fire switch and discharged three of the five cargo fire bottles.All of the occupants and crew evacuated the airplane through various exits and slides. During the evacuation at least 2 of the cabin crew received minor and serious injuries.Some passengers had retrieved bags from the overhead lockers after the aircraft stopped and before the evacuation command was given. The flight attendants agreed that carry-on bags that some passengers took while evacuating, were not a problem during the evacuation.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The failure of the left engine high-pressure compressor (HPC) stage 8-10 spool, which caused the main fuel supply line to become detached from the engine main fuel pump and release fuel, resulting in a fire on the left side of the airplane. The HPC stage 8-10 spool failed due to a sustained-peak low-cycle fatigue crack that initiated in the web of the stage 8 disk; the cause of the crack initiation could not be identified by physical inspection and stress and lifing analysis.

Of the 10 people aboard, three passengers died at the scene, the pilot and four passengers sustained serious injuries, and two passengers sustained minor injuries. Dark night, visual meteorological conditions prevailed a the time of the accident. The airplane was en route to a remote fishing site on the Swikshak River, about 75 miles northwest of Kodiak, Alaska. After takeoff the airplane began a gradual right turn before reaching a maximum altitude of 175 ft above the water. The airplane then descended toward the water's surface, flew low over the water and terrain, and then climbed briefly again before it impacted terrain. The pilot stated that he did not know that the airplane touched the water's surface after the initial liftoff or that it then turned right.A postaccident weight and balance study using the passenger weights, weighed cargo, and fuel load showed that the airplane exceeded its maximum gross weight of 8367 lbs (3795 kg) by about 508.6 lbs (230.7 kg) and that the center of gravity (CG) was 4.08 inches aft of the aft CG limit.Probable Cause ""The pilot's decision to depart in dark night, visual meteorological conditions over water, which resulted in his subsequent spatial disorientation and loss of airplane control. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to determine the airplane's actual preflight weight and balance and center of gravity (CG), which led to the airplane being loaded and  operated outside of the weight and CG limits and to a subsequent aerodynamic stall.""15-09-201515-09-201515-09-201515-09-2015",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2015

The flight crew comprised four pilots who were all in the flight deck during the departure. The operating crew consisted of one commander PF and a first officer PNF. The relief crew consisted of a captain and a first officer.The weather at Miami at the time of the departure was generally light northeasterly winds with good visibility, temperature was 29° C with scattered broken cloud at 2,900 ft., sunset occurred at 1925 hrs local time.The operating crew calculated the take-off performance figures for runway 09, using the On-board Performance Tool (OPT) contained within the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) using a take-off weight of 342,000 kg. The OPT offered the crew only one option for runway 09, which was 09#T1 as displayed by the OPT. This was understood by the crews to mean runway 09 full length, although the performance data had been pre-modified by a temporary NOTAM. The OPT also displayed the information that intersection departures were not permissible for this runway. An optimum performance take-off thrust calculation was selected on the OPT which generated an assumed temperature take-off thrust of 36°C. The commander printed off this information, for his reference, and his first officer wrote 09/(T1)# on his personal notepad.Pushback commenced at 2012 hrs local time. During the taxi, the crew conducted a take-off review as per the company SOPs, the SOPs did not require any reference to where on the runway the take-off roll would commence. The aircraft then joined taxiway S. Taxiway S parallels runway 09 and is the taxiway from which the aircraft was expected to join the runway. At this point the commander was using his EFB, selected to the airport diagram plate. He had the screen zoomed in, so he could clearly see the names of the taxiways as he passed them, although the scale selected, the size of his screen and the position of the chart, meant he was unable to see where he was in relation to the runway threshold..The relief captain had been following the aircrafts progress along the cleared route, using his tablet computer. As the aircraft entered taxiway S, he put his tablet away as he believed it was just a straight route to the runway.As they taxied along S the commander decided that the aircraft could depart from the runway intersection T1. He could not recall why he made that decision, but believed it may have been because the printed information displayed Runway 09#T1 in a compelling way. The printed information contained no reference to the fact intersection departures were not permissible from this runway, and contained the message No NOTAM data found.The commander requested the operating first officer to advise ATC that they were able to depart from intersection T1. The first officer glanced at his notes and saw he had written 09/(T1)#, which made him believe that this was an acceptable line-up point for take-off, he called ATC advising them that they were able to take T1 for departure from Runway 09.As this was not what relief crew recalled had been briefed, they queried T1. The commander made a hand gesture and said something which he thought was seeking reassurance from the crew that everything was OK. The operating first officer confirmed that he was content with T1, but the relief crew interpreted the commanders communication as him confirming he was content with a T1 departure so, thinking they had missed the operating pilots recalculating the take-off performance from T1 and did not voice any further concerns. At the time of this inter-crew exchange an aircraft landed on runway 09. This aircraft landed close to their position and reassured them that T1 was close to the start of the runway. The touchdown point on runway 09 was however displaced 411m from the threshold. From interviews with both crews, it was apparent that in the dark conditions, none of them had situational awareness of where T1 was in relation to the start of runway.The aircraft was then cleared to line-up with another aircraft reported on final approach, requiring an expeditious departure. The crew reported that as they lined up they were not visual with the end of the runway nor were they aware they had approximately 1,000m of runway behind them. The available take-off distance from T1 is approximately 2,610m.During the take-off roll, as the aircraft approached V1 the crew became aware that something was not right, and they recalled the aircraft entering the alternating red and white runway centreline lights which indicated they had approximately 900 m of runway remaining. The commander assessed the speed of the aircraft, the rate of acceleration and the runway remaining and concluded the safest course of action was to continue. He recalled as he rotated the aircraft entered the red runway centreline lights (indicating only 300 m of runway remaining.)None of the crew, including the cabin crew were aware that the aircraft made contact with the runway 27 approach lights as it got airborne, and the aircraft continued uneventfully to Doha, a flight time of 13.5 hours. There were no abnormal cabin pressurisation indications during the flight.The damage to the aircraft comprised of a 46 cm tear in the fuselage behind the rear cargo door which breached the pressure vessel. There were numerous dents and scratches in the external airframe with 18 square meters of damaged skin. There were 90 external individual areas of damage requiring assessment and rectification, there was also some damage to a metal guard on the left landing gear.",International Scheduled Passenger,,2015

While en route, approximately 140 nautical miles southeast of Norman Wells at 6500 feet above sea level, the crew noticed a drop in the right engine oil quantity indicator in conjunction with a propeller overspeed. The propeller pitch was adjusted to control the overspeed however, oil quantity indication continued to drop rapidly. A visual confirmation of the right engine nacelle confirmed that oil was escaping via the engine breather vent at an abnormally high rate. The right propeller speed became uncontrollable and the crew completed the ""Prop overspeed drill"". However, the propeller did not feather as selected. Several additional attempts were made to feather the propeller before it eventually feathered. The engine was secured and the shutdown checklist completed. The crew elected to divert to Tulita, NT (ZFN), but quickly determined that the descent rate would not permit that as an option. The only other option for diversion was Déline, NT (YWJ) where weather was reported at half a mile visibility and 300 feet ceiling. An emergency was declared with Déline radio. BFL525 was able to land at Déline however, the landing gear was not selected down to prevent further loss of airspeed resulting in a belly landing approximately midpoint of runway 08.

The flight crew consisted of a captain and copilot, who were the only occupants of the aircraft.The flight crew did not detect anything abnormal during the taxi and take-off roll, until the captain attempted to rotate the aircraft to the take-off pitch attitude. When the aircraft had achieved the required rotate speed, the captain applied the normal backpressure on the control column to achieve a standard rate of rotation, and the aircraft did not rotate. The captain then applied full backpressure and reported that the controls felt very heavy. Neither the captain nor the copilot detected any change in the aircraft's pitch attitude or any indication of pitch-up on the attitude direction indicator.The captain rejected the take-off, applied full braking and reverse thrust, but the aircraft overran the runway. The nose landing gear detached from the aircraft about 50 m beyond the end of the sealed runway, and the aircraft came to rest in long grass and mud. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, and the captain and copilot were uninjured.The aircraft did not accelerate normally as the acceleration was retarded by drag associated with rolling friction. This was indicative of partial brake pressure remaining during the take-off run. The partial brake pressure was possibly due to the parking brake being selected on at the holding point with enough pressure to retard aircraft acceleration during the take-off, but not sufficient to prevent the aircraft reaching rotate speed.Furthermore, the nose-down moment generated by the partial brake pressure probably prevented the aircraft rotating sufficiently to become airborne, despite normal nose-up elevator deflection.Heat in the brakes due to partial pressure during the take-off run may have reduced their effectiveness when the captain rejected the take-off, contributing to the runway overrun.Contributing factors- There was probably residual braking pressure in the wheel brakes during the take-off run.- The aircraft's parking brake was probably applied while at the holding point and not disengaged before taxing onto the runway for take-off.- The Citation aircraft did not have an annunciator light to show that the parking brake is engaged, and the manufacturer's before take-off checklist did not include a check toensure the parking brake is disengaged. - The aircraft experienced a retarded acceleration during the take-off run, and did not rotate as normal when the appropriate rotate speed was reached, resulting in a critical rejected take-off and a runway overrun.25-09-201525-09-2015",Ferry/positioning,ATSB ,2015

Following an intermediate stop at Saarbrücken the aircraft was cleared for takeoff on runway 09. During the rotation phase with approximately 127 KIAS and a nose-up attitude of approximately 5°, the landing gear retracted. The airplanes tail had the first ground contact and the tailstrike warning light illuminated. Approximately 875 m after the initial ground contact the airplane came to a stop after it had bounced three times and skidded on the fuselage.It appeared the first officer retracted the gear too early. It was determined that the DHC-8 landing gear will retract if the nose landing gear is airborne but the main landing gears are still on the ground. This design logic was changed after this accident.ConclusionsThe air accident was the result of an early retraction of the retractable landing gearduring take-off, which was not prevented by the landing gear selector lever and the retracting control logic.Contributory factors- Reduced concentration level- A break in the callout process / task sequence on the part of the PNF- Actuation of the landing gear lever to the UP Position too early- Control logic design allows retraction of the landing gear with one wheel airborne30-09-2015",International Scheduled Passenger,BFU Germany ,2015

The aircraft departed from Masamba/Andi Jemma Airport intended destination to Makassar-Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport on the island of South Sulawesi in Indonesia. The pilot-in-command acted as Pilot Flying while the second-in-command acted as pilot monitoring.According to the flight plan clearance issued by Andi Jemma Airport Air Traffic Information Service (ATIS) the pilot intended to fly VFR with altitude of 8000 feet and fly a direct route from Masamba to Makassar.The aircraft departed from Masamba at 0625 UTC (1425 LT) and estimated time of arrival Makassar at 0739 UTC.A partial cloud formation was present at about 60 nautical miles from Masamba on the direct track to Makassar around Mount Bajaja and Mount Latimojong.At 0636 UTC, the pilot informed the Ujung Pandang Information officer that the aircraft had reached 8,000 feet.

While conducting engine running on-load/offload operations at Jalalabad Airfield, the pilot raised the elevators mounted to the horizontal stabilizer by pulling back on the yoke. This provided additional clearance to assist with offloading tall cargo. After a period of time in which the pilot held the yoke by hand, he placed a hard-shell night vision goggle (NVG) case in front of the yoke to hold the elevator in a raised position.However, because the pilots were operating in darkened nighttime flying conditions and wearing NVGs, neither pilot recognized and removed the NVG case after loading operations were complete or during takeoff. Once airborne, the aircraft increased in an excessive upward pitch during the takeoff climb. The co-pilot misidentified the flight control problem as a trim malfunction, resulting in improper recovery techniques. The rapid increase in pitch angle resulted in a stall from which the pilots were unable to recover. The aircraft impacted approximately 28 seconds after liftoff, right of the runway, within the confines of Jalalabad Airfield.The aircraft struck the ground, a perimeter wall and a guard tower, which resulted in all personnel onboard the aircraft being killed, along with three Afghan Special Reaction Force (ASRF) members assigned to the tower.CONCLUSIONI find by the preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was pilot error due to the combination of the MPs [ mishap pilot] decision to place the hard-shell NVG case forward of the yoke blocking the flight controls, the distractions experienced by the MP and MCP [mishap co pilot] during the course of the ERO [Engine Running Onload/Offload], and the misidentification of the malfunction once airborne resulting in the destruction of the aircraft and cargo and the loss of fourteen lives. I also find, by a preponderance of the evidence, environmental conditions, inaccurate expectations, and fixation substantially contributed to the mishap.02-10-2015",Military,USAF AIB ,2015

The captain occupied the left seat and another pilot occupied the right. The second occupant worked for the operator of G-BYCP but his license was valid on Bombardier Challenger 300 and Embraer ERJ 135/145 aircraft and not on the King Air.The planned departure time of 0815 hrs was delayed because of poor meteorological visibility. The general weather conditions were fog and low cloud with a calm wind. At approximately 0850 hrs the visibility was judged to be approximately 600 m. At approximately 0915 hrs the visibility was at least 1,000 m and the pilot decided that conditions were suitable for departure.The planned departure was to turn right after takeoff and intercept the 128° radial from Brookmans Park VOR (BPK) heading towards the beacon, and climb to a maximum altitude of 2,400 ft amsl to remain below the London TMA which has a lower limit of 2,500 ft amsl. The aircraft took off at 0921 hrs and was observed climbing in a wings level attitude until it faded from view shortly after takeoff.After takeoff, the aircraft climbed on a track of approximately 205°M and, when passing approximately 750 ft amsl (565 ft aal), began to turn right. The aircraft continued to climb in the turn until it reached 875 ft amsl (690 ft aal) when it began to descend. The descent continued until the aircraft struck some trees at the edge of a field approximately 1.8 nm southwest of the airport. The pilot and passenger were both fatally injured in the accident, which was not survivable.ConclusionExamination of the powerplants showed that they were probably producing medium to high power at impact. There was contradictory evidence as to whether or not the left inboard flap was fully extended at impact but it was concluded that the aircraft would have been controllable even if there had been a flap asymmetry. The possibility of a preaccident control restriction could not be discounted, although the late change of aircraft attitude showed that, had there been a restriction, it cleared itself. The evidence available suggested a loss of aircraft control while in IMC followed by an unsuccessful attempt to recover the aircraft to safe flight. It is possible that the pilot lost control through a lack of skill but this seemed highly unlikely given that he was properly   licensed and had just completed an extensive period of supervised training. Incapacitation of the pilot, followed by an attempted recovery by the additional crew member, was a possibility consistent with the evidence and supported by the post-mortem report. Without direct evidence from within the cockpit, it could not be stated unequivocally that the pilot became incapacitated. Likewise, loss of control due to a lack of skill, control restriction or distraction due to flap asymmetry could not be excluded entirely. On the balance of probabilities, however, it was likely that the pilot lost control of the aircraft due to medical incapacitation and the additional crew member was unable to recover the aircraft in the height available.03-10-201503-10-2015",Ferry/positioning,AAIB ,2015

Both crew members escaped uninjured.In preparation for a positioning flight to Río Gallegos the crew failed to connect an inverter, a component of the electrical system that converts the direct current from 28V to an alternating current of 115V, prior to starting engine no.1. This was then rectified.At 0934 the aircraft taxied to the threshold of runway 05 for departure. The copilot was Pilot Flying while the experienced captain was Pilot Monitoring.Takeoff clearance was received at 0940 and the power levers were advanced. During the takeoff roll the copilot noticed that the no.1 engine N1 reached a value of 101% instead of 95% like the no.2 engine. At that point the aircraft had already traveled 380 m. It began to drift to the right of the runway centreline. The copilot decided to abort without voicing his intentions. he brought back the power levers to idle and began applying brakes. At this point, LV-ZSZ had traveled approximately 980 meters from the start of the take-off run.The right engine power decreased to 30-40% N1 while the left engine continued at a value over 101% N1. The captain then took over control. Differential braking was applied to steer the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. Thrust reversers were deployed briefly but the aircraft ran off the side of the runway. The aircraft impacted with a ditch located 80 meters from the runway, causing the undercarriage to break away.  After coming to rest with both engines now at 20% N1, the engine were shut down.As a result of the impact, part of the left tip tank fuel tank had separated, causing a fire that destroyed the aircraft.The most likely cause of the uncommanded acceleration and subsequent overspeed condition was a contamination of retained particles present within the fuel control unit (FCU). The contamination was a short-lived random condition, as evidenced by the fact that after about 30 seconds the power lever regained control of the left engine.Conclusions of the analysis (translated from Spanish)On a general aviation flight, during the take-off run, the LJ35 LV-ZSZ suffered a runway excursion on the right side, and a subsequent aircraft fire. The accident was due to the combination of the following factors- The uncommanded acceleration of the left engine at the start of the take-off run;- The initial lack of response of the left engine to the requests of the corresponding power lever;- The difficulties of the crew in managing an unusual condition of the aircraft in accordance with guidelines established in the AFM;- The ambivalence in the existing regulations for the authorization of a co-pilot in an aircraft that require two pilots for certification; and- The duality in the application of safety standards allowed by the existing normative regulations.Although unrelated, the state of the runway 05/23 protection zone at the San Fernando Aerodrome contributed to the severity of the accident.",Ferry/positioning,JIAAC Argentina ,2015

There were 94 passengers and six crew members on board. The aircraft, flight number BA6234, departed Port Elizabeth Airport at 0820 UTC on an instrument flight plan rule for Johannesburg. The first officer was the flying pilot for this leg. During approach to Johannesburg the aircraft was cleared for landing on runway 03R. The approach was flown with a tailwind (340° at 10 knots).After crossing the runway threshold, the first officer began flaring the aircraft at 65 feet instead of 20 feet as recommended by Boeing. This contributed to a low sink rate  (1.8 feet/second). The aircraft touched down at an excessive ground speed of 167 knots. The flight crew felt the aircraft vibrating, during which they applied brakes and deployed the reverse thrust. The left main gear collapsed approximately 5 seconds after touchdown, causing the aircraft to roll slightly low to the left. It later came to full stop around 35 seconds later, slightly left of the runway centreline, resting on its right main landing gear and the number one engine, with the nose landing gear in the air.The aircraft sustained substantial damage as the number one engine scraped along the runway surface when the landing gear detached from the fuselage. The occupants were allowed to disembark from the aircraft via the left aft door due to the attitude in which the aircraft came to rest.It was determined that the early flare and low sink rate on touchdown caused a condition in which excessive vibrations build up on the left landing gear and resulted in the upper torsion link failure. The thermal relief valve of the shimmy damper contained oil which could have impaired its effectivenessSignificant wear was found on the upper torsion link bushes, which could have contributed with the un-dampened vibration build up during operation.Probable CauseUnstable approach whereby the aircraft was flared too high with high forward speed resulting with a low sink rate in which during touch down the left landing gear experienced excessive vibration and failed due to shimmy events.26-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-201526-10-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CAA SouthAfrica ,2015

Overhead the Nuweibaa (NWB) NDB at FL210 the aircraft turned left, heading 340° to cross the Sinai Peninsula. Last contact with the flight was about 0613 hours. The Flight Data Recorder suddenly stopped at 061320 hours while the aircraft was climbing through 30,888 ft altitude with the autopilot engaged. Airspeed recorded at that time was 281 knots.Based on logged ADS-B data, flight tracking website Flightradar24 shows the aircraft climbing to 30875 feet, after which it shows erratic altitudes and speed indications. Last altitude recorded was 27925 feet at a speed of 62 knots.Investigators reported that they believed the aircraft broke up in the air. Footage from the crash scene shows a main impact zone of the forward fuselage and wings. Engines were found away from the main wreckage, as was the tail section of the aircraft.The debris is scattered over a wide area more than 13 km in length.The Russian Federal Security Service stated on November 16 that the crash was caused by a terrorist attack. Traces of explosives were found in the wreckage of the plane. During the flight, a homemade device with the power of 1.5 kilograms of TNT was detonated.The Russian Interstate Aviation Committee reported that it was determined that the aircraft skin had undergone high energy dynamic influence (from inside to outside) and that internal overpressure caused an inflight rapid decompression.31-10-201531-10-201531-10-201531-10-201531-10-201531-10-201531-10-20159 May 1997D-AVZKAirbus27 May 1997F-OHMPMEA - Middle East Airlines16 November 2001F-OHMPMEA2 June 2003TC-OAEOnur AirJanuary 2007TC-OAESaudi Arabian Airlines5 April 2007TC-OAEOnur AirNovember 2007TC-OAESaudi Arabian Airlines24 January 2008TC-OAEOnur Air30 July 2010TC-OAECham Wings Airlines29 September 2010TC-OAEOnur Air30 March 2012EI-ETJKolavia1 May 2012EI-ETJMetrojet",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,,2015

The flight took off from Karachi at 0808 local time. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and first officer (FO) was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the flight.The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Before initiating descent as per flight plan, the cockpit crew obtained latest weather of destination aerodrome Lahore which mentioned visibility 1200 meters. This visibility was below the minimum required (1600m) for carrying out a VOR/DME approach and necessitated decision for diversion to alternate aerodrome. The cockpit crew decided to continue for the destination. At 0859 local time the flight changed over to Lahore ACC, which cleared the flight the VOR/DME approach to runway 36L. Latest weather was reported a visibility of 1200 meters. Since runway 36R was closed for maintenance, the crew planned to follow the ILS procedure for runway 36R with intention to break off after acquiring visual with the runway and landing on runway 36L. This was a non standard procedure.The first officer failed to establish radio contact with the first diversion alternate, Sialkot International Airport. At this time, the FO discussed with the captain that in case of diversion their alternate aerodrome was Peshawar which required additional fifty minutes of flying time.At 0904 it was discussed if an RNAV approach could be flown and the captain told the FO to request an RNAV approach. However, the aircraft was not equipped with mandatory navigation equipment (GNSS). At this stage, when the FO was cross checking the arrival procedure on the Flight Management Guidance Computer (FMGC) he noted that by mistake the captain had selected runway 18L instead of runway 36L and the FO was advised to change the arrival procedure. The conversation between captain and FO at this time indicates that the captain had difficulty in identifying/reading and feeding the correct arrival procedure due to inability in concentration.The FO was continuously found to be prompting the captain for decision making. In order to calculate RVR for their VOR/DME approach runway 36L, the FO calculated RVR as 1800 meters by multiplying visibility (1200m) with 1.5. He lacked the knowledge of RVR calculation procedure and did not consider availability of other services at runway 36L, like high intensity approach lighting system (HIALS) or high intensity runway lights (HIRL). The incorrect calculation of the RVR value was not corrected by the Captain as well. In fact, RVR was the same (1200m) as the reported visibility. The required RVR for carrying out a VOR/DME approach by a Cat C airplane on runway 36L was 1600m.At 0912, the cockpit crew changed frequencies to Lahore Approach as cleared by Lahore ACC. Lahore Approach found the flight being right of track and inquired if they were right of track. The captain quickly asked the FO to tell Lahore Approach that they were following the RNAV procedure for runway 36L. Further descent instructions were given. At 0916 Lahore Approach cleared the flight for the RNAV LEMOM ONE CHARLIE arrival runway 36L and, ""descend down to 3000 ft on QNH 1018 hecto pascal and report position ELAMA"". The FO acknowledged the approach by correctly reading back. At 0920 Lahore Approach observed the flight passing through FL85 at 20 track miles which was approx 2000-2500 ft higher than the assigned altitude. At this time, the cockpit crew selected Flaps-1, 2 and 5 in quick succession in order to increase the rate of descent. Speed brakes were not used. Lahore Approach contacted the flight to reconfirm whether they would be able to make approach or discontinue due to being high.The captain immediately prompted FO to reply by saying ""Affirmative"". At this stage, it is established that the flight was neither following the track (it was right of track) nor the assigned altitudes as per ATC clearance.  The FO then suggested the captain to use the speed brake so that the flight could quickly descend to the desired altitude. The captain in response voiced ""haye...haye...haye"" indicating that he was exhausted and unable to cope  with the situation.At 0922 the captain asked the FO to lower Flaps-10 and lower the undercarriage. The FO complied with the instructions and confirmed. The captain again voiced ""haye...haye...haye"". At this stage, they also lowered Flaps-15, landing lights on and Flaps-30. The captain asked FO to complete landing checklist which was accomplished successfully.When the flight reported position over ELAMA, the Lahore Approach controller observed the flight to be at 5000 ft altitude instead of already cleared 3000 ft. The duty controller cautioned the flight by telling them that their altitude at ELAMA should have been 3000 ft whereas he had observed it to be 5000 ft. He also advised them to continue at pilot's own responsibility. After passing over ELAMA, the flight turned left heading 355° and lowered Flaps-30. The speed at this time was 180 kts and flight was descending through 5000 ft. At 0923 the captain disengaged the autopilot at 9NM from RWT to lose the excess height by increasing rate of descent and also executed turns to acquire the runway. However, the captains decision to disengage autopilot at this stage without being visual with the runway increased his workload. Resultantly, the aircraft descended with very high descent rate from 20003500 ft/min. The excessive rate with Flaps-30 selected resulted in exceeding the flap speed limit.By the time the flight reached 4.6 NM from runway threshold, the altitude was almost correct but they were still not visual with the runway. The cockpit crew was actually carrying out a VOR/DME approach instead of the RNAV approach for which the aircraft was not suitably equipped. The captain kept flying the aircraft with no visual cues due poor visibility, increased stress level, loss of situational awareness and reduced mental ability which led to ending up low on approach with high speed. The approach was unstabilized at that point.At 0924 the captain asked the FO whether the runway was visible. The FO replied in negative and advised the captain to engage the autopilot, which could make runway contact easier. However the autopilot was not engaged.When reported at 4 DME, the controller cleared the flight to land runway 36L. The runway was still not sighted as the airplane was descending through 460 ft AGL. Airspeed at that time was 150 kts, which was 14 knots above the calculated landing speed.Just before the aural alert ""Minimums"" sounded, the FO saw the runway towards the right. The FO also took over the controls and asked the captain to inform ATC that the runway was in sight. The aircraft temporarily levelled off at 400 ft AGL for approximately 7 seconds and simultaneously a right turn was initiated. While descending below 400 ft AGL, the vertical speed kept varying between -1100 ft/min to -180 ft/min. At 200 ft AGL, power was advanced to 55%-65% which increased airspeed and temporarily decreased sink rate. Although the FO picked up visual with the runway at Minimum Descend Altitude (MDA) by chance, the aircraft was not stabilized and a go around should have been initiated instead..At 0925 the captain also sighted the runway at approximately 150ft and took over the controls from FO. However, the captain was still unable to correctly align the aircraft with the runway, as the aircraft had ended up towards right side of the runway and a left turn was required. The FO was found asking the captain to turn left but the captain advised the FO to 'relax'. After descending through 100 ft AGL, the FO made an effort to take over the controls from the captain in order to land the aircraft. The captain was heard uttering ""Haye...Ok...Haye...Oh..."" indicating total exhaustion and inability to cope up with the situation. The captain was unaware that he was still holding the controls despite handing over to FO. The FO was heard urging the captain to leave the controls. The captain again voiced, ""Haye...Oh"". The FO was busy in landing the aircraft while the captain kept uttering exhausting voices besides being hyperventilated.At 0926 the aircraft touched down 1400 feet from the threshold, to the left of the centreline. An 8° right bank and 4.5° crab angle caused the right hand main landing gear to touch the runway first. Airspeed was 166 knots, as opposed to the reference speed (Vref) of 134 knots. The speed brakes deployed and the aircraft slightly bounced. The left main gear touched down, followed by the right main gear again. The left main gear then broke after a shimmy. With thrust reversers being deployed, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway. Upon entering soft soil, the right main gear also broke. The aircraft skidded 8000 feet before coming to rest. An evacuation was carried out.An investigation revealed that the blood alcohol level of the captain was 83 mg/dl (BAC 0.07%). Many countries use a legal limit for drivers of 0.05%. Moreover, the blood lactate level of 70 mg/dl interprets fatigue due to increased stress as the normal level ranges from 4.5 to 23 gm/dl.Cause of Occurrence. The accident took place due to1. Cockpit crew landing the aircraft through unstabilized approach (high ground speed and incorrect flight path).2. Low sink rate of left main landing gear (LMLG) as it touched down and probable presence of (more than the specified limits) play in the linkages of shimmy damper mechanism. This situation led to torsional vibrations / breakage of shimmy damper after touchdown. The resultant torsional excitation experienced by the LMLG due to free pivoting of wheels (along vertical axis) caused collapse of LMLG.3. The RMLG collapsed due to overload as the aircraft moved on unprepared surface.03-11-2015",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CAA Pakistan ,2015

On approach the undercarriage indicator lights showed the gear was not down and locked. A warning sounded as the crew prepared for landing. Instead of executing the manual extension procedure as required, the flight crew decided to land anyway. This resulted in the undercarriage to retract upon touching down on runway 18 at Taichung.There were no personal injuries. The plane sustained damage to the propellers and belly.Findings related to probable causes1. The 2-ampere circuit breaker which controls power source for the landing gear popped up after the occurrence aircraft having landed shows that electricity for the power pack was cut off when the aircraft was in the process of landing, so the motor could not operate to build up pressure.2. When the occurrence aircraft was landing the first time, abnormal status of the indicating light for the landing gear down-and-locked was already existed. It was possible that the 2-ampere circuit breaker which controls the power for power pack of the landing gear had popped up before the first landing attempt, thus incapacitating the hydraulic system, rendering it impossible to build up necessary pressure for operating the landing gear. The subsequent two more operations by the flight crew to lower and down lock the landing gear also failed due to insufficient pressure within the landing gear system.3. During the occurrence aircraft landing, the landing gear not down and lock indication and warning sound came out when the flight crew extended the landing gear and flaps.

All nine occupants of the aircraft were killed. No one was injured inside the building.The airplane, flight EFT1526, departed Dayton-Wright Brothers Airport, Ohio at 1413 hours local time. The first officer was Pilot Flying. About 1438, the Akron-Canton terminal radar approach control facility provided radar vectors to the accident airplane for the localizer runway 25 instrument approach procedure at Akron Airport. A Piper PA-28-161 airplane performing flight training at the airport was preceding the BAe-125 on the approach. According to the flight instructor on board the Piper, the airplane ""broke out at minimums"" on the localizer runway 25 approach and landed on runway 25. This information was relayed to the accident aircraft after it reported over the Unicom frequency.About 1449, the captain made mention of a high pitch and a concern about a recurrence of decreasing speed, and the first officer mentioned the planned approach speed. At 1450 the captain had a discussion with the first officer about not wanting to stall the airplane. The last ATC transmission from EFT1526 occurred about 1450 when they advised ATC they were changing to the advisory frequency.Full flaps were requested by the FO about 1451, and about a minute later the first officer called out a descent to minimums. About 1452, the captain made mention of diving 2,000 feet per minute, followed by the cockpit sounds of the windshield wipers and the captain mentioning the ground.About 1452, the captain made a call out to level off, followed by the sounds similar to a stick shaker and a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) aural alert.The aircraft was seen banking to the left as it clipped electrical and telephone wires on Mogadore Road. It then hit an apartment building and slammed into an embankment.Preliminary investigation findings show that both accident pilots were newly hires by Execuflight in June 2015. The captain's previous employment was terminated after he failure to show up for a Hawker 800A Recurrent Training session.The first officer's previous employment was terminated due to ""unsatisfactory work performance."" During training he struggled among others with memory items and weight and balance calculations.The fact that the first officer was Pilot Flying was contrary to company policy. First officers normally only fly empty legs.Also, the weight and balance of the accident flight was incorrect because, among others, the weight of the APU had not been included in the Basic Operating Weight.  On departure the maximum takeoff weight was exceeded by 286 pounds. The estimated landing weight exceeded the maximum landing weight by the same amount.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crews mismanagement of the approach and multiple deviations from company SOPs, which placed the airplane in an unsafe situation and led to an unstabilized approach, a descent below MDA without visual contact with the runway environment, and an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident were Execuflights casual attitude toward compliance with standards; its inadequate hiring, training, and operational oversight of the flight crew; the companys lack of a formal safety program; and the FAAs insufficient oversight of the companys training program and flight operations.""10-11-201510-11-201510-11-201510-11-201510-11-201510-11-201510-11-201510-11-2015",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2015

This flight was intended to transport executives from the company that owned the aircraft.During preparations for the return leg to Congonhas Airport, the primary pitch trim system failed. As a consequence the autopilot could not be used. According to Brazilian Regulations the aircraft was not allowed to depart in this state, however the flight crew elected to depart.The flight took off on the flight back to Congonhas Airport at 1839. During the initial climb, the secondary pitch trim system was activated. At 1853, some 14 minutes after takeoff, the flight crew attempted to engage the autopilot and the primary pitch trim system was switched on again. It was not possible to engage the autopilot and the secondary pitch trim system was again activated. As the aircraft was climbing through FL340, the flight crew requested to continue to FL410. This was authorised. At 1903 the crew again switched to the  primary pitch trim system. The horizontal stabilizer then moved to a nose-down position and the warning clacker sounded in the cockpit. The aircraft had reached a highest altitude of 36800 feet and from that moment on it entered a rapid descent. The crew switched back to the secondary pitch trim system but failed to perform the 'Pitch Trim Runaway or Failure' emergency procedure. Control could not be regained and the aircraft impacted a farm field near Guarda-Mor, Brazil. All four aboard were killed.Contributing factors.- Control skills - undetermined.It is possible that, after inadvertent movement of the horizontal stabilizer, the crewmembers did not operate on the control switches of the secondary pitch trim system, since no other warning sound (Clacker) was recorded on the CVR recordings.The action prevised in the emergency procedures Pitch Trim Runaway or Failure, item 3, regarding trimming of the aircraft through the secondary system, possibly, was not performed.The performance of the crew may have been restricted only to the elevator control on the aircraft controls or to the control of the stabilizer associated with the primary trimming mode.- Attitude - undetermined.The decision to make the flight without the proper functioning of the primary pitch trim and autopilot system may have been the result of the pilot's self-confidence because of the successful previous flight under similar operating conditions.Considering the hypothesis that the updated Shutdown Checklist, which should incorporate the Stabilizer Trim Backdrive Monitor - TEST, was not performed after the pre-crash flight, one could consider that there was a lack of adhesion to the aircraft operating procedures.Such an attitude could be associated with the pilot's self-confidence about the aircraft's operating routine, whose acquired experience could have given him the habit of ignoring some of the procedures deemed less important during the flight completion phase.- Crew Resource Management - a contributorThroughout the flight, there was an absence of verbalization and communication of the actions on the checklist.Similarly, in the face of the emergency situation of the horizontal stabilizer (Pitch Trim Runaway or Failure), no statements were identified regarding the actions required to manage this situation among the crew.These characteristics denote inefficiency in the use of human resources available for the aircraft operation.- Training - undetermined.It is possible that the absence of a periodic training in simulator, especially the emergency Pitch Trim Runway or Failure, has affected the performance of the crew, as far as the CVR did not record statements related to the actions required by the abnormal condition experienced.- Organizational culture - undetermined.The operator did not usually properly fill out the PT-WQH flight logbook. This condition evidenced the existence of informal rules regarding the monitoring of the operational conditions of the aircraft. In this context, it is possible that the history of failures related to the pitch trim system has not been registered.- Piloting judgment - undetermined.Moments prior to takeoff, it was recorded in the CVR speeches related to the flight without the autopilot, possibly related to a failure or inoperativeness of the primary pitch trim system.The takeoff with a possible failure in the pitch trim system of the aircraft, showed an inadequate assessment of the risks involved in the operation under those conditions.- Aircraft maintenance - undetermined.It was not possible to establish a link between the maintenance services performed on the aircraft in September 2015 and the events that resulted in the accident occurred on 10NOV2015.However, it was not ruled out that an incomplete crash survey was carried out in the pitch trim system of the aircraft, due to the lack of detail of the service orders.- Decision-making process - a contributor.The sounds related to the test positions of the Rotary Test Switch have not been recorded in the CVR recording, so it is possible to conclude that the Warning Systems - Check item of the Cockpit Preparation Checklist has not been performed.The decision to perform the flight without the complete execution of all items of the Cockpit Preparation Checklist, prevented the correct verification of the primary longitudinal Trim system of the aircraft and reflected an inadequate judgment about the risks involved in that operation.- Interpersonal relationship - undetermined.According to the CVR data, there was a possible rush of the crew to take-off, even though it was verified that the aircraft's pitch trim system did not work properly.It was not possible to determine if this rush was motivated by passengers pressure or self-imposed by the pilot.- Support systems - undetermined.It is possible that the Pilots' Abbreviated Checklist - NORMAL PROCEDURES, aboard the aircraft, was outdated, without the incorporation of the Stabilizer Trim Backdrive Monitor - TEST procedure in the Shutdown Checklist.The possible completion of Shutdown Checklist with outdated procedures would have hampered the manufacturer's suggested verification for identification of abnormalities in the aircraft's pitch trim system.- Managerial oversight - undetermined.The records and control of the operational check flights, both by the maintenance shop and by the operator, prevised in documentation issued by the manufacturer (SB650-27-53 and ASL650-55-04) were not performed in an adequate manner, indicating possible weaknesses in the supervision of the maintenance activities.10-11-201510-11-2015",Executive,CENIPA ,2015

He met with an associate there and handed a suitcase as well as a briefcase to the secretary of the person he visited. He indicated that his wife would come and pick it up at some stage and gave her his wifes name and contact number with instructions to call her at 1030 hours. The aircraft departed Lanseria Airport at 0821 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL360. The last radio contact with the flight was in the vicinity of Kimberley. The aircraft entered the FACA FIR (Area Control Centre) airspace without any communication from the pilot. During the course of these events, Air Traffic and Navigation Services tried in vain on all frequencies to make contact with the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Eclipse began to deviate from the planned route.At 1037 the aircraft was observed to commence with a right turn, during which the height of the aircraft varied by 2000 feet, remaining between FL350 and FL370. The aircraft completed a 360° turn to the right and immediately commenced with a second right-hand turn. After it had completed the second 360° turn, it was observed to fly in an easterly direction for a brief period, during which the aircraft was observed to have climbed to an altitude of FL376, after which it descended and again entered into a right-hand turn at 1044 at an altitude of FL330.The aircraft completed the third right-hand turn at 1047 at an altitude of FL305. After completing the turn, it immediately entered into a fourth right-hand turn at an altitude of FL326 and a speed of 377 knots. The aircraft completed the 360° turn at 1048 at FL317. The aircraft was then observed flying in an easterly direction for a period of approximately 4 minutes when again it entered into a right-hand turn at 1052 at FL321 and a speed of 290 knots. From the radar footage this orbit was observed to be very tight, as the aircraft was observed to have completed the 360° turn at 1053 at an altitude of FL335 and a speed of 446 knots. The last time the accident aircraft was observed on radar was at 1055 when it was at an altitude of 12300 feet, a speed of 396 knots and a heading of 008°.At 1055 the aircraft was intercepted by a Saab Gripen supersonic military jet from the South African Air Force (SAAF), which had been dispatched from Air Force Base Overberg. The Gripen pilot could not get close enough to the aircraft to observe whether the pilot of ZS-DKS was conscious or not. The Eclipse jet spiralled towards the ground in a left wing low attitude until it impacted the terrain. Shortly after the aircraft had departed Lanseria, the pilot's wife was contacted by SMS about the bags. It appeared she was not aware why the bags were left at Lanseria for her and stated she had no plans of going there. The investigators reported that it was not uncommon for the pilot to drop of bags during his company travels like this, but in this case it remained unexplained why he took a detour to Lanseria to drop of the bags.Probable cause It was observed that the aircraft performed a series of unexplainable as well as erratic flying maneuvres, which resulted in a loss of control and the aircraft to enter into a spiral dive, which was observed by the Gripen pilot before colliding with the ground.07-12-2015",Private,CAA SouthAfrica ,2015

There were no injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The first pilot, who was the owner of the light jet and had recently received a type rating in the airplane, was acting as pilot-in-command for the flight and was seated in the left seat. A second pilot, who was also type-rated and experienced in the airplane make and model and was accompanying the first pilot as a mentor, was seated in the right seat and handled radio communications throughout the flight. As they neared the destination airport for an approach to runway 16, the pilots received the most recent weather information, which included wind from 250 degrees at 16 knots (kts) with gusts to 29 kts. Shortly thereafter, another pilot on the frequency reported wind gusts of 50 kts upon landing. The first pilot expressed concern about landing in such windy conditions, but the second pilot encouraged him to continue. About 45 ft above the runway, the airplane experienced a strong gust of wind; the left wing impacted the ground, and the second pilot initiated a go-around. The second pilot then reconfigured theairplane for a landing on runway 30; the aural ""wind shear"" warning was sounding throughout the approach. Upon touchdown, the airplane's right main landing gear exited the runway surface and impacted the raised curb between the grass and taxiway surface. Both pilots reported that there were no preaccident airplane anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.The maximum demonstrated crosswind component of the airplane was 25 kts.

The first flight was planned to depart at 0900.The pilot went to the Wasaya apron and conducted a pre-flight inspection of C-FKDL while a ground crew was loading cargo. The pilot returned to the hangar and received a briefing from the station manager regarding the planned flights. The pilot was advised that the first officer assigned to the flight had been reassigned to other duties in order to increase the aircraft's available payload and load a snowmobile on board.The pilot completed and signed a Wasaya flight dispatch clearance (FDC) form for WSG127, and filed a copy of it, along with the flight cargo manifests, in the designated location in the company operations room. The FDC for WSG127 showed that the flight was planned to be conducted under visual flight rules (VFR), under company flight-following, at an altitude of 5500 feet above sea level (ASL). Time en route was calculated to be 66 minutes, with fuel consumption of 413 pounds.The pilot returned to the aircraft on the apron. Loading and fueling were complete, and the pilot conducted a final walk-around inspection of C-FKDL. Before entering the cockpit, the pilot conducted an inspection of the upper wing surface.At 0854, the pilot started the engine of C-FKDL and conducted ground checks for several minutes. At 0858, the pilot advised on the mandatory frequency that WSG127 was taxiing for departure from runway 09.WSG127 departed from runway 09 at 0900, and, at 0901, the pilot reported on the  mandatory frequency that the flight was airborne. The flight climbed eastward for several miles and then turned left toward the track to  mandatory frequency. At about 3000 feet ASL, WSG127 briefly descended about 100 feet over 10 seconds, and then resumed climbing. At 0905, the pilot reported that WSG127 was clear of the mandatory frequency zone.WSG127 intercepted the track to Angling Lake and climbed northward until the flight reached a peak altitude of about 4600 feet ASL at 090841, and then began descending at 090846. At 090916, the flight made a sharp right turn of about 120° as it descended through about 4000 feet ASL. At 090939, the descent ended at about 2800 feet and the aircraft climbed to about 3000 feet ASL before again beginning to descend. At approximately 0910, WSG127 collided with trees and terrain at an elevation of 1460 feet ASL during daylight hours.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Although the aircraft was prohibited from flying in known or forecast icing conditions, Wasaya Airways Limited Partnership (Wasaya) flight 127 (WSG127) was dispatched into forecast icing conditions.2. The high take-off weight of WSG127 increased the severity of degraded performance when the flight encountered icing conditions.3. The pilot of WSG127 continued the flight in icing conditions for about 6 minutes, resulting in progressively degraded performance.4. WSG127 experienced substantially degraded aircraft performance as a result of ice accumulation, resulting in aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and collision with terrain.5. The Type C pilot self-dispatch procedures and practices in use at Wasaya at the time of the occurrence did not ensure that operational risk was managed to an acceptable level.6. Wasaya had not implemented all of the mitigation strategies from its January 2015 risk assessment of Cessna 208B operations in known or forecast icing conditions, and the company remained exposed to some unmitigated hazards that had been identified in the risk assessment.7. There was a company norm of dispatching Cessna 208B flights into forecast icing conditions, although 4 of Wasaya's 5 Cessna 208B aircraft were prohibited from operating in these conditions.11-12-201511-12-201511-12-201511-12-2015",Cargo,TSB Canada ,2015

Nine of the 138 passengers and crew onboard received minor injuries during the evacuation and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane landed normally on runway 20R and exited at taxiway B2. ATC instructed the flight to taxi to the ramp (gate C20) via taxiway B, T3, and T4. The captain reported he used landing lights to assist in the taxi along B and T3 and then extinguished the landing lights as the airplane crossed runway 13/31, but left the taxi lights on.The flight crew reported that they had difficulty locating taxiway T4 as it appeared dark and there was glare from the terminal lights ahead. About 15 seconds prior to the excursion the airplane began a left turn briefly to a heading of about 065 degrees. Taxiway T4 was oriented about 045 degrees. The crew was searching for the turn to the ramp when the airplane then turned back to the right to a heading of 090 degrees, consistent with the heading toward gate C20. Three seconds later the airplane exited the taxiway into a grassy area with a large drainage ditch, east of the intersection of taxiways T4 and J. The nosegear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest angled to the right, on the left nacelle, right wing tip, and nose.Shortly after the airplane came to rest an audible alarm began sounding in the cockpit which the flight crew indicated they could not silence. The pilot advised ATC that ""we've cut the corner here and are off in the grass"" and asked for ARFF equipment.When the airplane stopped all the cabin lights went out for some time before the emergency lights came on.

The forecast surface wind at Newcastle was from 230° at 28 kt, gusting to 38 kt, with a 40% probability that the strength could temporarily increase to 38 kt, with gusts to 55 kt.This night-time flight proceeded normally and the aircraft was established on an ILS approach for Newcastle's runway 25. The runway was reported as damp, with the surface wind from 240° at 30 kt, gusting to 43 kt when landing clearance was given. ATC provided further surface wind checks of 240° at 37 kt and then of 240° at 27 kt, two minutes and one minute before touchdown, respectively. The pilots reported that the approach felt bumpy but not unduly turbulent, and they were satisfied that neither the operator's maximum crosswind limit of 30 kt nor the maximum operating wind speed of 50 kt were likely to be exceeded.The aircraft was configured with the flaps set to 22° for landing, and the target approach speed (VAPP) was 139 kt, 15 kt greater than the calculated reference speed (VREF) to allow for the wind. The pilots recalled the wings were kept almost level until the flare commenced, with the aircraft's nose pointing slightly left of the runway centreline, to compensate for the crosswind.Just before touchdown, the aircraft rolled left rapidly. The PF turned the control wheel right, to counteract what he and the co-pilot both perceived to be a sudden gust from the right, and they thought that the aircraft subsequently touched down smoothly. Neither of the pilots heard any aural warnings and they proceeded to a parking area where the aircraft was shut down and the passengers were disembarked.An ATC controller thought he saw a spark from the vicinity of the aircraft when it landed and asked an airfield operations officer to investigate. A technician, working abeam the touchdown zone, told the operations officer that the aircraft had seemed to roll to one side while landing. The operations officer inspected the runway and found witness marks, which started approximately 270 m from the displaced threshold and 1 m to the left of the runway centreline. Following the accident, surface abrasions were noted to the left wingtip fairing and the left aileron. Subsequent examination proved that the wingtip fairing could be repaired but the aileron was damaged beyond acceptable limits and was replaced.The pilot's impression was that there was a sudden, large gust of wind from the right while flaring to land. Recorded data suggested the aircraft's roll to the left during the flare was more likely caused by a sudden slackening of the strong gusty wind, from slightly left of the runway centreline.The maximum angle of bank recorded was 12.8° at 4 ft radio altitude; less than the angle calculated by the manufacturer for a wingtip strike with the left wheel touching the ground.However, this calculation does not allow for aerodynamic loads and does not account for the runway sloping away from the centreline.The AAIB was not informed of the accident until a month later.

Another consideration was the operating hours of Ende which would be closed at 1700.The operating hours of Ende was extended and the aircraft departed Ende at 1716. Again the captain acted as PM and the SIC acted as PF. There was no departure briefing performed by the PF.After takeoff, the pilot set the Flight Management System (FMS) to fly direct to KPG VOR and climbed to a cruising altitude of FL175.During cruise flight, the pilots monitored communication between the El Tari Tower controller and another pilot. El Tari Tower advised that the visibility at Kupang was 1 km while the minima for approach was 3.9 km. At 1727, the pilot established communication with El Tari Tower controller and requested for direct to initial approach point SEMAU.At 1732 the aircraft started to descend to 10,000 feet. When the aircraft passed FL150, the pilot requested to turn left to fly direct to the inbound track of the VOR/DME approach for runway 07 in order to avoid cloud formation which was indicated by magenta color on the aircraft weather radar.At 1741, the El Tari Tower controller informed that the visibility on runway 07 was 4 km and issued clearance for an RNAV approach to runway 07 and requested that the pilot report when the runway was in sight.Both pilots discussed the plan to make an RNAV approach to runway 07, with landing configuration with flap 5 and auto-brake set to position low. At 1743, the pilot reported that the runway was in sight when passing 2,500 feet and the El Tari Tower controller informed that the wind was calm and issued a landing clearance.During the approach, the PF noticed that all Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights indicated a white color, which indicated that the aircraft was too high for the approach. Recognizing that the aircraft was too high, the crew performed a non-standard configuration setting by extending the landing gear down first with the intention to increase drag. The landing gear was extended at approximately 7 NM from the runway 07 threshold and afterwards selected the flaps to 1 and 2. The published approach procedure stated that the sequence for establishing landing configuration is by selecting flap 1, flap 2, landing gear down, flap 3 and flap 5.On final approach, the crew noticed the aural warning ""HIGH SPEED HIGH SPEED"". The copilot also noticed that the aircraft speed was about 200 knots, which was about 62 knots higher than the target speed. The pilots decided to continue the approach considering the runway was 2,500 meters long and would be sufficient for the aircraft to stop with the existing conditions. The pilots compared the runway condition at Kupang with the condition at Ende which had 1,650 meter length runway.On short final approach, the aircraft was on the correct glide path and the speed was approximately 205 knots. The PF noticed the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) warning of ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" activated. The aircraft then touched down at approximately the middle of the runway. After touchdown, the PF immediately applied thrust reversers.Realizing that the aircraft was about to overrun the end of the runway, and with the intention to avoid the approach lights on the end of the runway, the captain turned the aircraft to the right.The aircraft stopped approximately 200 meters from the end of runway 07.Contributing Factors- The steep authority gradient resulted in lack of synergy that contributed to least of alternation to correct the improper condition.- Improper flight management on approach resulted to the aircraft not fully configured for landing, prolonged and high speed on touchdown combined with low brake pressure application resulted in insufficient runway for deceleration.- The deviation of pilot performance was undetected by the management oversight system.21-12-201521-12-201521-12-2015November 2006PT-SIIEmbraer1 December 2006G-FBEBFlybe8 May 2015PK-KDCKalStar Aviation",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSC Indonesia ,2015

All ten on board were killed.The aircraft was scheduled to perform a round trip from Delhi to Ranchi, India. As per the weight & load data sheet there were 8 passengers with 20 kg of baggage in the aft cabin compartment. The actual take-off weight shown was 5668.85 kg, which was just below the maximum take-off weight of 5669.9 kg Fuel uplifted was 1085 kg.The passengers were mainly technical personnel who were to carry out scheduled maintenance of a Mil Mi-17 helicopter of the Border Security Force at Ranchi. They were carrying their personnel baggage along with tools and equipment required for the maintenance. While the personal baggage was 152 kg (8 kg below the 20 kg per person used in the calculations), tools and equipment weighed at least another 63 kg.At around 0915 hrs the flight crew contacted ATC Delhi and requested for clearance to operate the flight to Ranchi. The aircraft was cleared to Ranchi via R460 and FL210. Runway in use was given as 28. At 0918 hrs the doors were closed and the flight crew had started carrying out the check list. After the ATC issued taxi clearance, the aircraft had stopped for some time after commencing taxiing. The pilot informed the ATC that they would take 10 minutes delay for further taxi for administrative reasons. The taxi clearance was accordingly cancelled. After a halt of about 6 to 7 minutes, the pilot again requested the ATC for taxi clearance. The Tower then cleared the aircraft to taxi via E, line-up and wait on runway 28. The aircraft was then cleared for take-off. The weather at the time of take-off was Visibility 800 meters with Winds 100 degrees at 3 knots.The speed call outs were given followed by rotate call out after the aircraft attained a speed of 110 knots at 51 seconds before the crash. Shortly after take-off and attaining a height of approximately 400 feet AGL, the aircraft progressively turned left with simultaneous loss of height. At 43 seconds before the crash, the Pilot Monitoring (PM) asked the Pilot Flying to maintain direction. At 21 seconds prior to the crash, the PM realised that the heading mode of the autopilot was not engaged, so he attempted to fly the aircraft manually. Simultaneously, at 17 seconds prior to the crash there were successive warnings of the autopilot disengage, altitude alert, bank angle alarm and stall warning alarm. At 8 seconds prior to the crash the stall warning alarm came on. The alarm continued till the end along with Bank Angle warning from the EGPWS. The aircraft had taken a turn of approximately 180° and impacted some trees before hitting the outside perimeter road of the airport in a left bank attitude. Thereafter, it impacted head on with the outside boundary wall of the airport. After breaking the outside boundary wall, the wings impacted two trees and the aircraft hit the holding tank of the water treatment plant. The tail portion and part of the fuselage overturned and went into the water tank. There was a post impact fire and the portion of the aircraft outside the water tank was destroyed by fire. All passengers and crew received fatal injuries due impact and fire. The total PIC experience of the PF on the B200 aircraft was 7700 hours and that of the PM was 19635 hours as PIC. The PF was released as PIC after 62035 hours of co-pilot experience on Type, while the PM was released as PIC after 183 hours of co-pilot experience on Type. Most of the on Type experience of these two flight crew was gained while flying amongst themselves. Despite written instructions of the Accountable Manager that an experienced pilot should be on board as the second pilot whenever the PF or PM were flying as PIC, these low experienced pilots did not fly under supervision of an experienced pilot while building their respective PIC experience.Therefore, in such a scenario there was no opportunity available to this flight crew to identify their deficiencies in flying techniques, operational procedures, correct interpretation of the effects of weather, airmanship, etc. and applicable appropriate correction/ response even though a well experienced and seasoned Senior Pilot on Type was available in-house. Also, the series of occurrences in the past 6 months prior to the crash and their non-reporting indicates lack of flying expertise and complete non-supervision of their unsafe acts.Probable Cause of the AccidentThe accident was caused due to engagement of the autopilot without selecting the heading mode by the flight crew just after liftoff (before attaining sufficient height) in poor foggy conditions and not taking corrective action to control the progressive increase in left bank; thereby, allowing the aircraft to traverse 180° turn causing the aircraft to lose height in a steep left bank attitude followed by impact with the terrain.",Military,AAIB India ,2015

The pilot, co-pilot, five passengers, and the snowplow operator were not injured and the airplane was substantially damaged during the accident. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The flight departed Monterrey, Mexico, with a planned stop in El Paso, Texas, en route to Telluride, Colorado.Prior to departure from Monterrey, the crew obtained preflight information, including NOTAMs for the planned route of flight. The NOTAMs for Telluride (KTEX) noted several runway closure times; however, none of the closures were valid for the period during which the flight would arrive at KTEX.The flight departed El Paso at 1220 MST and the flight crew discussed the weather conditions at their destination airport, including concern that the weather maybe below minimums and may not allow for a landing. The Montrose Regional Airport (KMTJ), Colorado, was discussed as an alternate destination. As the flight neared their destination, the crew was in contact with a Denver en-route/center controller. The crew also listened to the Telluride's airport automated weather station.At 1348, the controller asked the pilots to advise him when they had the weather and NOTAMS for KTEX, adding that another airplane just attempted an approach into KTEX, but had to execute a missed approach. The pilot reported that they received the weather information and planned to make the approach. The controller responded by giving the flight a heading, saying this would be for the descent and sequence into the airport.At 1350, the airport operator entered a NOTAM via computer closing the runway (effective 1350) for snow removal, and the airport operator proceeded onto the runway. At 1358, the controller cleared the accident airplane for the approach to the airport. The pilot then cancelled his flight plan at 1402 with the airport in sight. The crew did not change radio frequency to the airport's common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for traffic advisories.During the landing, the crew did not see the snowplow on the runway until it was too late to avoid a collision.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The limitations of the air traffic control equipment that prevented the controller's timely recognition of NOTAM information that was effective immediately and resulted in the issuance of an approach clearance to a closed runway. Also causal was the pilots' omission to monitor and transmit their intentions on the airport common frequency. Contributing to the accident was the controller's heavy workload and the limitations of the NOTAM system to distribute information in a timely manner.""23-12-201523-12-2015",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2015

Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the Anaktuvuk Pass Airport at the time of the accident. The flight departed from the Fairbanks Airport, about 1030, destined for Anaktuvuk Pass. The pilot stated that he was flying along the John's River about 2,500 feet msl, 500 feet above ground level (agl) while en route to Anaktuvuk Pass Airport (AKP).

Both pilots were killed.The aircraft departed Oslo-Gardermoen Airport, Norway at 2310 hours local time on a mail and package flight to Tromsø, Norway. The take-off, departure and climb to cruising altitude, flight level 330, were performed according to normal procedures. The flight was uneventful until one minute and 20 seconds before the impact. The event started at 001920 hrs, one hour and ten minutes into the flight in night time conditions of darkness without moonlight, clouds or turbulence. The lack of external visual references meant that the pilots were totally dependent on their instruments which consisted of three independent attitude indicators.Suddenly a very fast increase in pitch was displayed on the left attitude indicator. The pilot in command, who was the pilot flying and seated in the left seat exclaimed a strong expression. The displayed pitch change meant that the pilot in command was subjected to a surprise effect and a degradation of spatial orientation. The autopilot was, most probably, disconnected automatically, a ""cavalry charge"" aural warning and a single chime was heard, the latter most likely as a result of miscompare between the left and right pilots' flying displays (PFD).Both elevators moved towards nose down and nose down stabilizer trim was gradually activated from the left control wheel trim switch. The airplane started to descend, the angle of attack and G-loads became negative up to -1 G. Both pilots exclaimed strong expressions and the co-pilot said ""come up"".About 13 seconds after the start of the event the crew were presented with two contradictory attitude indicators with red chevrons pointing in opposite directions. At the same time none of the instruments displayed any comparator caution due to the PFDs declutter function in unusual attitude.Bank angle warnings were heard and the maximum operating speed and Mach number were exceeded 17 seconds after the start of the event, which activated the overspeed warning.The speed continued to increase, a distress call was transmitted and acknowledged by the air traffic control and the engine thrust was reduced to flight idle.The crew was active during the entire event. The dialogue between the pilots consisted mainly of different perceptions regarding turn directions. They also expressed the need to climb. At this stage, the pilots were probably subjected to spatial disorientation. The aircraft collided with the ground one minute and twenty seconds after the initial height loss.Investigation revealed that the erroneous attitude indication on PFD 1 was caused by a malfunction of the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU 1). The pitch and roll comparator indications of the PFDs were removed when the attitude indicators displayed unusual attitudes. In the simulator, in which the crew had trained, the corresponding indications were not removed. During the event the pilots initially became communicatively isolated from each other.Factors as to cause and contributing factorsThe accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of a failure in a redundant system.Contributing factors were- The absence of an effective system for communication in abnormal and emergency situations.- The flight instrument system provided insufficient guidance about malfunctions that occurred.- The initial manoeuver that resulted in negative G-loads probably affected the pilots' ability to manage the situation in a rational manner.Factors as to riskThe fact that fault descriptions regarding aircraft and its components are reported in a less detailed manner might imply that the faults will not be identified and corrected in an efficient way. This can in turn lead to a flight safety issue as, for instance, intermittent faults cannot always be detected by general tests.08-01-2016Jan 1993C-GRJWCanadair2 Feb. 1993D-ACLELufthansa CityLineD-ACLELufthansa CityLine27 September 2006C-FJGIBombardier2007C-FJGIBombardier14 May 2007SE-DUXWest Air Sweden",Cargo,SHK Sweden ,2016

At 095221, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts).At 095501, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 095516, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 095547, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 095616, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand.""At 095632, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 095645, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 095659, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 095706, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 095712, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 095720, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 095801, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 095826, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly.""At 095846, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 095853, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 095912, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 095913, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 095917, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb.""About 095947, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 095949 and 095958, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm.The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation.Probable Cause ""The pilot's loss of control due to spatial disorientation while operating in instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's design stress limitations, and a subsequent in-flight breakup. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's reported inflight instrumentation anomaly, the origin of which could not be determined duringthe investigation.""18-01-201618-01-201618-01-201618-01-201618-01-2016",Private,NTSB ,2016

The tour included a scenic flight over the Great Barrier Reef for about 50 minutes before heading to Chance Bay, on the south-east tip of Whitsunday Island, about 11 km north east of Hamilton Island Airport. Following a water landing at Chance Bay, the group was to spend 90 minutes at the beach before a short flight back to Hamilton Island. The tour was originally planned to include a landing at Whitehaven Beach, however wind conditions at the time required the water landing be altered to Chance Bay.The aircraft approach Whitsunday Island from the north and conduct an orbit about 2 km north of Whitehaven Beach at about 1510, before heading toward Whitehaven Beach. It flew over the southern end of Whitehaven Beach and the strip of land that separates it from Chance Bay.The pilot advised that he flew over the western end of Chance Bays main beach in order to conduct a visual pre-landing check of the bay. The pilot noted the positions of various vessels moored in the bay to determine the best taxi path to the beach. During this fly-over, the pilot also noted the sea state and observed evidence of wind gusts on the water surface. The pilot then initiated a right downwind turn toward the landing area. The approach was from the south with the intent to land in the most suitable location within the designated landing area and then taxi to the beach.The pilot reported setting up for landing at about 50 ft above the water and then delayed the landing in order to fly through an observed wind gust. Passenger video footage indicated that, during the subsequent landing, WTY bounced three times on the surface of the water. After the second bounce, with WTY getting closer to the beach and terrain, the pilot increased engine power and initiated a go-around. The third bounce, which occurred almost immediately after the second, was the most pronounced and resulted in the aircraft rebounding about 30 to 50 ft above the water. While increasing power, the pilot perceived that the torque was indicating red, suggesting an over-torque for the selected propeller configuration. Noticing that the climb performance was less than expected with the flaps at 30°, the pilot stopped increasing power and reduced the flap to 20°.As the aircraft climbed straight ahead towards a saddle, climb performance was still below the pilots expectations and he assessed that WTY would not clear the terrain. In response, the pilot turned right to avoid the surrounding rising terrain. The aircraft clipped trees during this turn, before colliding with terrain and coming to rest in dense scrub about 150 m from the eastern end of the main beach, near the top of the ridge. The pilot promptly advised the passengers to exit and move away from the aircraft. Some of the 11 people on board suffered minor injuries but all were able to quickly leave the aircraft. There was no post-impact fire.Contributing factors- The aircraft's initial touches with water were past the nominated decision point and beyond the northern boundary of the ALA, which reduced the safety margins available for a successful water landing or go-around.- The pilot initiated a go-around without using all available power and the optimal speed, turned towards higher terrain and placed the aircraft in a down-wind situation, which ultimately resulted in the collision with terrain.Other findings- The aircraft was equipped with lap-sash seatbelts, which have been demonstrated to reduce injury, and the use of emergency beacons and satellite phone facilitated a timely response to the accident.",Passenger,ATSB ,2016

In fact, after asking the captain if the brakes were ""OK"", the first officer assumed they were referring to the ""parking brake"" but he did not explain that clearly.The outward vision of the commander was changed by rainwater running down the windshield, which did not allow him to detect the plane's rolling. Despite intervention by the first officer on the movement of the aircraft, the captain did not have time to slow down.Since then, the aerodrome operator has modified the procedures for ramp agents on this parking area.

The aircraft landed safely on runway 27 and was about to vacate the runway via taxiway N9 when the right main landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries to any person onboard the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.The landing was carried out by co-pilot and captain was carrying out Supervised Line Flying (SLF). During landing flare, aircraft floated a little and the touchdown was normal. The aircraft landed with a  vertical acceleration of 1.44 G. About 16 seconds after touch down, at a speed of around 58 kts, there was right roll of 4.57° and the aircraft started veering to the right with a noise which felt like a tire burst to the cockpit crew. To maintain directional control first officer moved the tiller. The aircraft vacated via taxiway N9 and stopped on the taxiway with the tail of the aircraft not fully clear of runway 27. Taxiway N9 is about 2600 meters/8550 feet down the runway 27.Flaps were moved to 40, in case if the situation warranted an evacuation. Thereafter, the captain contacted the Jet Airways dispatcher. Also, the APU was started and engine no.2 was shut down, followed by engine no.1. Meanwhile the airport fire service attended as the ATC controller had observed sparks from the right side of the aircraft after landing. On arrival of passenger stairs, the occupants were safely disembarked through the L1 door and no emergency evacuation was carried out.An investigation revealed that a main landing gear aft trunnion pin had failed as a result of improper grinding during overhaul. Several trunnion pins were overhauled by the same company. The first failure occurred on April 13, 2015 to a Jet Airways Boeing 737-800. During landing rollout at Khajuraho Airport, the left hand main gear aft trunnion pin failed. According to maintenance records two sets of trunnion pins had been overhauled. As a precautionary measure, on 20 August 2015, the aft trunnion pins of VT-JGC were removed from the aircraft. After the accident involving VT-JGD, it appeared from maintenance records that in fact three sets of trunnion pins (including VT-JGD) had been overhauled by the same company.PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT The Committee of inquiry determined the cause of accident as ""The RH Aft landing Gear trunnion pin failed due to base metal heat damage as a result of abusive grinding of the chrome plate that likely occurred during the last overhaul"".",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2016

Neither of the 2 flight crew were injured. The flight originated from the Louisville International Airport (SDF), Kentucky.The airplane sustained damage to a 23 foot long section of lower fuselage skin, 4 fuselage stringers, 5 fuselage frames, 3 floor stringers and the tail skid. The replacement of the frames and stringers was considered a major repair.According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer the pilot monitoring for the flight from SDF-ABQ. Ground operations were normal in SDF and no aircraft loading or Weight and Balance discrepancies were noted. The climb, cruise, and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. Weather conditions at ABQ prior to arrival were reported as visual conditions, with wind from 090 at 20 knots gusting to 29 knots. The target approach speed used was 146 knots. The crew was vectored to the ILS approach to runway 03 and joined the localizer and glideslope using the autopilot. The autopilot was then disengaged at 1103 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) and at 1000 feet HAT the approach met all UPS Stabilized Approach criteria with the aircraft fully configured at flaps 30, gear down, and speed 145 knots. At 500 feet HAT the approach continued to meet all stabilized approach criteria with speed 146 knots. Flight data indicated that the crosswind component at this point was 23 knots from the right.At 158 feet above touchdown the approach met all stabilized approach criteria and the captain disconnected the autothrottles. UPS guidance recommends use of the autothrottle until 50 feet above touchdown. From this point on the approach until touchdown, the aircraft pitch attitude began to increase as the airspeed slowly decreased. Flight Data indicates that the thrust levers were at a reduced thrust setting when the autothrottles were disconnected and remained at that setting until touchdown. At 1.75 seconds from touchdown the airspeed had decayed to 129 knots and the aircraft pitch had increased to 7.2 degrees. The crosswind had also decreased and was now 13 knots from the right. At touchdown the airspeed was 128 knots and pitch attitude 8.4 degrees. The tailskid impacted the runway at touchdown followed immediately by the lower aft fuselage as the pitch attitude increased momentarily to 8.6 degrees. Initial tailskid impact occurred at approximately 800 feet from the runway threshold.The crew reported that they encountered a 10 knot wind loss just prior to touchdown and landed firmer than normal, but didn't suspect that they had struck the tailskid.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot flying's failure to maintain airspeed and correct pitch attitude. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain appropriate thrust after disconnecting the autothrottles. Also contributing was the first officer's failure to monitor the decaying airspeed and increasing pitch.""05-03-2016",Cargo,NTSB ,2016

Three Ukrainian crew members died in the crash and another was critically injured. The aircraft operated a scheduled cargo flight from Cox's Bazar to Jessore in Bangladesh. The on board cargo consisted of 802 boxes of shrimp weighing 4800 kg.The flight crew requested startup clearance at 0258 UTC. The aircraft was then cleared to taxi to runway 35 via taxiway S. Takeoff clearance was given 0305 UTC. During takeoff a drop in oil pressure in the torque meter system of engine no.1 caused the engine to lose power the cruise mode. The captain decided to continue takeoff. Immediately after becoming airborne the pilot reported an engine failure and requested for immediate return back to Cox's Bazar Airport. He was advised by ATC to report left hand down wind. Within 60 seconds after takeoff the no. 1 lost power completely.The captain initially tried to maneuver the aircraft to land on runway 17 (departure runway, opposite direction), but was unable to line up with the runway.The crew decided to continue on a right hand downwind at around 1000 feet with a IAS of 300km/h in clean configuration. The aircraft turned to final and fully configured for landing and stable at around 3.5 NM from the runway. But at 1.2 NM for reasons unknown the captain decided to go around and climbed to 400-500 feet. ATC advised the captain to report left hand down wind. But there was no response from the crew. The aircraft had impacted the shallow waters on the coast, 3 km West of the airport.Causesa) Failure to initiate a rejected take off during take off roll following the indication of engine failure;b) Failure to adhere to the company SOP following the detection of the engine failure during take off;c) Considering the poor visibility at Cox's Bazar Airport, diverting to the alternate airfield Chittagong Airport located only 50 nm away that has the provision for full ILS approach facility.

The takeoff weight was within limits. The calculated V1 and V2 speeds were 104 Kts and 106 Kts respectively, whereas the stalling speed was 84 Kts. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and the first officer was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for this sector. However, the first officer was a qualified captain on Beechcraft 1900D aircraft.The aircraft taxied out at 0805 hours local time. The aircraft start up and taxiing was normal.The flight was given runway 25L for takeoff and the aircraft lined up on the runway. After obtaining takeoff clearance, the flight crew completed pre take off checks with no abnormalities observed.At 082306, take off thrust was applied very gradually and the aircraft started to roll. Five seconds after reaching maximum power, at 082335 the PM announced the speed being 80 kts. FDR data indicated an increasing trend in torque and drop in propeller rpm of engine no. 2, which was not monitored by the flight crew. The propeller rpm dropped to a minimum 709 rpm in the next 11 seconds. Also, torque of engine no.1 began to drop, without any significant change in rpm. The aircraft was still rolling for takeoff and accellerating through 95 kts. When the no. 2 engine propeller rpm started to drop, the PF announced that the aircraft began drifting towards the right. The PM replied ""continue...continue"".At 082344 when the aircraft was reaching 96 kts, the PM asked PF to turn left and apply left rudder. The flight crew did not realize at this stage that there was a problem with both engines and they were still below V1 which, as per pre flight calculation, was 104 kts. At 082349 the first officer asked the captain to increase the power of the left engine. By this time the drop in no. 1 engine torque had been arrested. It appears that the first officer had a glance on torque indicator and asked the captain to increase power. At 082353 the captain glanced at the engine instruments and wanted to express his concern about loss of power. Before being able the first officer announced V1...rotate at 082355 and 101 kts of speed.After getting airborne, the aircraft continued to drift towards the right. In order to control the dropping speed and direction loss, the first officer took over the controls.At 082408 when decreasing speed had reached 98 kts the first officer asked the captain to raise the landing gears in order to reduce drag and gain speed. The aircraft had climbed to approximately 39 feet above ground and the captain asked the first officer to lower the nose in order to gain speed. At 082419 when the aircraft was at 101 kts and approximately 41 feet above ground level, the first officer asked the captain to raise the flaps. While the aircraft was losing altitude, the maximum speed of 105 kts was recorded and aircraft was passing through 10 feet above ground level. Also, at this time the first officer asked the captain to reduce left engine power. The first officer judged that there was no option other than to make the aircraft land on the remaining runway. The aircraft hit the runway surface with landing gear retracted, approximately 9000 ft from the beginning of runway 25L. The aircraft continued to drag on the runway while continuously drifting right for 800 ft before departing towards right side on the fair weather strip.After travelling approximately 600 ft on the fair weather strip, the aircraft veered towards the left and came to a final stop on the runway 1050 ft short from end of runway.As the captain was seriously injured, the first officer brought fuel control levers, propeller levers and power levers back; put the battery and generators off after the aircraft came to halt.

The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured.Flight 981 departed Dubai at 1837 hours UTC on March 18. The en route part of the flight was normal. The flight arrived near Rostov and the crew performed a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected. Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear.At 2242 UTC (0142 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions.The flight left the holding pattern at 0028 UTC (0328 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another approach to runway 22. As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway after receiving another windshear alert. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust.In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15° and retracted the landing gear.At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15° to 10° at a speed of over 200 knots.The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact.The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s.At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground.The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

This resulted in a loss of control of the aircraft and its impact with the ground. The accident is classified as Loss of Control In-Flight (LOC-I) occurrence.Most probably, the contributing factors to the accident were- the presence of turbulence and gusty wind with the parameters, classified as a moderate to-strong ""windshear"" that resulted in the need to perform two go-arounds;- the lack of psychological readiness (not go-around minded) of the PIC to perform the second go-around as he had the dominant mindset on the landing performance exactly at the destination aerodrome, having formed out of the ""emotional distress"" after the first unsuccessful approach (despite the RWY had been in sight and the aircraft stabilized on the glide path, the PIC had been forced to initiate go-around due to the windshear warning activation), concern on the potential exceedance of the duty time to perform the return flight and the recommendation of the airline on the priority of landing at the destination aerodrome;- the loss of the PICs leadership in the crew after the initiation of go-around and his ""confusion"" that led to the impossibility of the on-time transition of the flight mental mode from ""approach with landing"" into ""go-around"";- the absence of the instructions of the maneuver type specification at the go-around callout in the aircraft manufacturer documentation and the airline OM;- the crews uncoordinated actions during the second go-around on the low weight aircraft the crew was performing the standard go-around procedure (with the retraction of landing gear and flaps), but with the maximum available thrust, consistent with the Windshear Escape Maneuver procedure that led to the generation of the substantial excessive nose-up moment and significant (up to 50 lb/23 kg) ""pushing"" forces on the control column to counteract it;- the failure of the PIC within a long time to create the pitch, required to perform go around and maintain the required climb profile while piloting aircraft unbalanced in forces;- the PICs insufficient knowledge and skills on the stabilizer manual trim operation, which led to the long-time (for 12 sec) continuous stabilizer nose-down trim with the subsequent substantial imbalance of the aircraft and its upset encounter with the generation of the negative G, which the crew had not been prepared to. The potential impact of the somatogravic ""pitch-up illusion"" on the PIC might have contributed to the long keeping the stabilizer trim switches pressed;- the psychological incapacitation of the PIC that resulted in his total spatial disorientation, did not allow him to respond to the correct prompts of the F/O;- the absence of the criteria of the psychological incapacitation in the airline OM, which prevented the F/O from the in-time recognition of the situation and undertaking more decisive actions;- the possible operational tiredness of the crew by the time of the accident the crew had been proceeding the flight for 6 hours, of which 2 hours under intense workload that implied the need to make non-standard decisions; in this context the fatal accident occurred at the worst possible time in terms of the circadian rhythms, when the human performance is severely degraded and is at its lower level along with the increase of the risk of errors.The lack of the objective information on the HUD operation (there were no flight tests of the unit carried out into the entire range of the operational G, including the negative ones; the impossibility to reproduce the real HUD readings in the progress of the accident flight, that is the image the pilot was watching with the consideration of his posture in the seat trough the stream video or at the FFS) did not allow making conclusion on its possible impact on the flight outcome.At the same time the investigation team is of the opinion that the specific features of the HUD indication and display in conditions existed during final phase of the accident flight (severe turbulence, the aircraft upset encounter with the resulting negative G, the significant difference between the actual and the target flight path) that generally do not occur under conditions of the standard simulator sessions, could have affected the situational awareness of the PIC, having been in the highly stressed state.19-03-201619-03-201619-03-201619-03-201619-03-201619-03-201619-03-201619-03-201619-03-2016",International Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2016

It traveled the last 600-800 meters of runway without increasing or reducing speed. Subsequently the pilot-in-command decided to steer the plane off the runway to avoid collision with the ILS system and stopped both engines. The aircraft collided with a mound of earth, causing structural damages.Conclusions of the analysisOn a general aviation flight, during landing at the International Airport Governor Ramon Trejo, there was runway excursion 25 on the right side of the runway. The aircraft was stopped by impact against a mound, causing the recorded damage.The reasons for the runway excursion could not be established with certainty due to the lack of solid evidence. However, we were able to identify two factors of relevance to operational safety- The divergence from the regulations referring to runway margins, which caused the damage to the aircraft. While this deficiency was not related to causality with the accident, influenced the severity of it.- The absence of a brake system failure procedure.",Unknown,JIAAC Argentina ,2016

Approximately two minutes before 9H-AMZ landed, with the aircraft flying a stabilised final approach about 4 NM from the runway threshold, an Airbus A319 commenced its take-off run from the start of runway 05 and took off around 40 seconds later. The crew of 9H-AMZ flew over the displaced threshold of runway 05 with the correct approach profile and at the correct reference speed, and commenced the flare at a radio altitude of 10 ft. Moments later, the aircraft was caught by a positive wind shear of around 13 kt and rolled into a slight right bank, which the crew countered withan aileron deflection to the left. Immediately afterwards, the aircraft suddenly and severely rolled on its longitudinal axis to a left bank angle of 12.1°. The crew immediately countered this with a vigorous aileron deflection to the right. Nevertheless, 9H-AMZ struck the runway with its left wingtip and subsequently touched down with the main landing gear whilst at an almost horizontal bank attitude. The process of slowing down and taxiing from the runway was uneventful. The occupants of 9H-AMZ were not injured. The aircraft was damaged on the left outer leading-edge slat.CausesThe accident, in which a business aircraft touched the runway with one wingtip (wingtip strike), can be attributed to a high bank angle during the landing flare. The most probable cause for this high bank angle was found to be wake turbulence from a commercial aircraft that had previously taken off on the runway, which caused the business aircraft to roll around its longitudinal axis.The accident was caused by the combination of the following factors- Light wind weather conditions, which delayed the decay of wingtip vortices;- A prolonged landing flare near the ground, which led to a touchdown at the end of the landing zone at low airspeed;- Insufficient distance between the displaced runway threshold and the point of rotation of an aircraft, which had previously taken off.",Executive,STSB Switzerland ,2016

On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables. The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured.The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine.The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing. The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine.Contributing factorThe aircrafts centre of gravity was significantly aft of the aft limit. When landing flap was set, full nose-down elevator and elevator trim was likely to have had no effect in lowering the nose of the aircraft. Unless the flaps had been retracted immediately, the nose-up pitch may also have resulted in tailplane stall, exacerbating the pitch up. The wings stalled, followed immediately by the right wing dropping. Recovery from the stall at such a low height was not considered possible.Other factorsOther factors is used for safety deficiencies or concerns that are identified during the course of the investigation, that while not causal to the accident, nevertheless should be addressed with the aim of accident and serious incident prevention, and the safety of the travelling public.a) Following the reweighing of SBC, the operator did not make adjustments to account for the shift of the moment arm as a result of the reweighing. Specifically, a reduction of allowable maximum weight in the baggage compartment.b) The pilot, although signing the flight manifest on previous flights attesting that the aircraft was loaded within c of g limits, had not computed the c of g. No documentation was available to confirm that the pilot had computed the c of g for the accident flight, or any recent flights.c) All of the High Frequency radio transmissions between Air Traffic Services and SBC were significantly affected by static interference and a lot of hash, making reception difficult, and many transmissions unclear and unreadable. This is a safety concern to be addressed to ensure that vital operational radio transmissions are not missed for the safety of aircraft operations, and the travelling public.13-04-201613-04-201613-04-201613-04-201613-04-2016",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2016

The visibility at Gander was 1/8 statute miles (sm) in heavy snow.The weather forecast for the time of arrival was wind 360° magnetic (M) at 35 knots, gusting to 55 knots; visibility 1/4 sm in heavy snow and blowing snow; vertical visibility 100 feet above ground level (agl). Starting at 2230, the visibility was forecast to increase to 1/2 sm in moderate snow and blowing snow, and the vertical visibility was to improve to an overcast ceiling at 400 feet agl. A significant meteorological information (SIGMET) message was issued indicating severe turbulence below 3000 feet agl over an area of Newfoundland that included Gander.The crew planned to conduct the instrument landing system with distance measuring equipment precision approach for runway 03 (ILS/DME RWY 03) at Gander. The captain called the company's acting operations manager to discuss the potential operational impact if the flight had to divert to its alternate. At first, the intent was to delay the flight for an hour to wait for the snowfall intensity to diminish and for the visibility to improve. However, after speaking with the acting operations manager, the captain decided to depart as scheduled, anticipating that the weather conditions would improve by the time they reached Gander. The crew was unaware that other carriers had cancelled their flights to Gander. The aircraft departed at 1945 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. There were 14 passengers and 2 crew members on board. The first officer (F/O) was the pilot flying. While en route, the F/O indicated that he did not feel comfortable conducting the approach and landing due to his limited experience and the potential challenges associated with the anticipated weather conditions. The captain agreed to conduct the approach and landing.During the flight, the crew received updated weather reports from both the Gander Area Control Centre and Gander Tower, which indicated an increase in visibility from 1/8 sm to 1/2 sm and a reduction in the snowfall intensity from heavy to light. The crew decided that the visibility was sufficient to conduct the approach as initially planned. The winds and blowing snow were not identified as concerns.While the flight was en route, snow removal was in progress at Gander. The airport plows were focused on clearing the middle 120 feet of the 200-foot-wide runway. The plows had pushed the snow into windrows along both sides of the runway, about 60 feet from the centreline.The crew contacted the tower controller for the runway surface condition report. The latest runway condition report for runway 03, taken at 2044, was as follows 120 feet cleared width, 40% dry snow with a depth of 0.13 inches and 60% bare and dry; remaining width 100% dry snow with a depth of 4 inches; remarks - windrows along reported width with a depth of 10 inches.The snowplows continued plowing the runway until about 2110, at which point they began to plow a path for the aircraft to follow from the runway to the apron.On the approach, about 12 minutes before touchdown, the aircraft began to encounter moderate turbulence through 5700 feet above sea level. This turbulence continued until landing and was significant enough that the passengers were experiencing discomfort.Once the aircraft intercepted the localizer, control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain as planned. The landing gear was lowered and the flaps were set to full, as per the company's standard operating procedures.At 2124, the tower controller cleared flight 7804 to land and provided the crew with the current tower winds of 360°M at 36 knots, gusting to 44 knots. The crew acquired the runway approach lighting at about 800 feet agl, more than 2 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold.At approximately 2130, while on short final, the crew asked for a wind update. The tower controller informed the crew that the tower winds were currently unavailable and provided the last aerodrome special meteorological report (SPECI), which had been taken 18 minutes before. The SPECI indicated that the winds were 350°M at 29 knots, gusting to 41 knots.In the landing flare, the captain asked the F/O to call out the heights on the radar altimeter to help them determine how high they were above the ground. Almost immediately, the 10- and 0-foot calls were made. There was no indication that the crew lost visual contact with the runway edge lighting.At about 2130, the aircraft touched down on its main landing gear (MLG) to the right of the centreline at a normal descent rate and in a relatively flat attitude about 2800 feet from the threshold. The crew was unaware how far to the right of the centreline they were when they touched down. Almost immediately, the aircraft veered to the right when the right-side MLG encountered snow. The nose landing gear (NLG) struck the windrow of compacted snow, which caused the NLG to collapse. As the aircraft's nose began to drop, the propeller blades struck the snow and runway surface. All of the left-side propeller blades and 3 of the right-side propeller blades separated at the blade root. A portion of a blade tip from the right-side propeller penetrated the cabin wall at floor level.The aircraft slid down the runway, with the nose coming within 27 feet of the runway edge, before crossing back through the windrow toward the centreline.The aircraft came to a stop about 14 seconds after touchdown on a heading of about 350°M. The nose was about 15 feet to the right of the centreline and 3400 feet from the threshold.Once the aircraft came to a stop, the F/O opened the cabin door and evacuated the passengers. The captain shut down the engines. The tower controller did not have any ground radar and was unaware that the aircraft was stopped on the runway. The captain contacted the tower controller to report the situation and request assistance. The tower controller immediately activated the crash bell.The first fire truck left the station within 1 minute of the crash bell being activated. About 2 minutes later, the plow drivers, who were cross-trained as fire rescue personnel, drove the remaining 2 fire trucks and the rescue vehicle to the aircraft.Because the location of the aircraft was not known, the vehicles started at the north end of runway 03. They proceeded cautiously because of the reduced visibility from blowing snow and because the passengers were out on the runway. The first fire truck arrived at the aircraft about 6 minutes after the accident. In total, 3 fire trucks, 1 rescue vehicle, and 2 pickup trucks responded.Once the firefighters established that there was no fire, the rescue vehicle and pickup trucks started transporting passengers to the terminal. Within 25 minutes of the crash bell being activated, all passengers and crew had been transported to the terminal. Three passengers sustained minor injuries. None of the injuries were attributed to the portion of the propeller blade that had penetrated the cabin.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Neither pilot had considered that the combination of landing at night, in reduced visibility, with a crosswind and blowing snow, on a runway with no centreline lighting, was a hazard that may create additional risks.2. The blowing snow made it difficult to identify the runway centreline markings, thereby reducing visual cues available to the captain. This situation was exacerbated by the absence of centreline lighting and a possible visual illusion caused by blowing snow.3. Due to the gusty crosswind conditions, the aircraft drifted to the right during the landing flare, which was not recognized by the crew.4. It is likely that the captain had difficulty determining aircraft position during the landing flare.5. The flight crew's decision to continue with the landing was consistent with plan continuation bias.6. During landing, the nosewheel struck the compacted snow windrow on the runway, causing the nose landing gear to collapse.20-04-201620-04-2016",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2016

The airplane sustained substantial damage and there were no reported injuries among the 6 crew and 87 passengers onboard.The aircraft departed Quito at 0651 hours local time. During the landing preparation briefing, at 0734, the pilot indicated that they would hold the glide slope until they had a runway in sight, inhibit the glide slope alarm, and continue visual. Four minutes later the flight was cleared for the VOR ILS ZULU approach for runway 23. The runway was wet due to drizzle and the braking efficiency reported by an Airbus A319 was good to average. The A319 had landed on the runway in Cuenca 36 minutes before flight 173. At 0746, the flight radioed that they were ten miles out and established on the localizer. They were cleared to the ILS approach for runway 23. Three minutes later the controller reported that they had flight 173 in sight and informed that the wind was calm, and cleared the flight to land on runway 23. TAt 0750, the pilot indicated that he had three red and one white lights on the PAPI system.  The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 37 feet high instead of 50 feet, which meant the aircraft approached below the normal glidepath. It touched down 277 m past the threshold at an airspeed of 127 knots. Spoilers were deployed 585 meters from the threshold, followed by reverses at 643 m.The pilot, not feeling an effective braking of the aircraft, tried to activate the autobrake system but this did not work. The aircraft was hydroplaning and could not be brought to a halt on the runway. The pilot groundlooped the aircraft on the grass.Runway 23 is a 1900 m long runway with an upslope of 15 m (+0.78%). Distance from the centre of the end of the paved runway to the boundary fence and an active road is 31 m.	The Operational Landing Distance calculations with manual braking for the weight of the aircraft with wind on touchdown, indicate that a runway length of 2,122 meters was necessary.PROBABLE CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Spanish language report)The Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were1. The condition of the runway at Cuenca airport, which at the time of the plane's landing was contaminated with water and slippery.2. The landing was made after a non-stabilized approach with a tailwind.3. The non-application of the Maximum Performance Landing procedure recommended by the aircraft manufacturer for landing on contaminated runways.The following factors contributed to this event1. The dispatch of the flight with 1,500 kg of fuel more than the amount of fuel usually used for this flight.2. Omission of the runway length calculation necessary to perform the landing using the braking efficiency information.3. The crew's decision to make the final approach with three red and one white lights, using the PAPI system, induced by the information in the Terminal Information document issued by the company, which authorised this procedure.4. The use of confusing terminology in the Terminal Information document, which used terms applicable to the Airbus fleet, instead of Embraer's.5. The crew's decision not to perform the thwarted approach maneuver after the maximum allowable vertical speed was exceeded and visibility was apparently limited after the minima were exceeded.6. Incorrect use of aircraft braking aids, in this case reverse braking aids7. The application of the emergency brake that inhibits the antiskid system.8. Lack of implementation of adequate management of crew resources, particularly within the cockpit.9. Lack of training in the use of tables for track distance calculation.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,JIA Ecuador ,2016

The aircraft was approaching runway 08 at Catania Airport when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. The approach was abandoned about 1037 hours. The airplane climbed to 2900 feet and entered a holding pattern to the east of the airport while the crew tried to troubleshoot the problem. Finally a forced landing was carried out on runway 08 at 1134 with the nose gear doors open but the nose gear retracted.CAUSES  The accident was caused by the failure of the nose landing gear (nose gear up) due to over-extension of the shock absorber which caused interference between the tires and the NLG compartment and locked the NLG in a retracted position. The over-extension was caused by the incorrect installation of some internal components of the shock absorber during the replacement of the internal seals the day before the accident.  The following factors contributed significantly to the improper activity conducted at maintenance - the insufficient experience of technical personnel in carrying out the maintenance tasks conducted on the NLG; - the lack of controls on the operations carried out, deemed unnecessary by the CAMO engineering department; - the lack of definition of roles and tasks during the planning phase of the maintenance work; - the operational pressure on maintenance personnel, arising from the need to conclude maintenance operations quickly in order not to penalize the management of the aircraft; - the insufficient clarity and lack of sensitive information in the maintenance tasks and related figures contained in the AMM, regarding the replacement of internal shock absorber seals, subsequently made clearer by the manufacturer; - the reported black and white printing of the applied AMM procedures, which could have made the warnings in the manual barely legible.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ANSV ,2016

The airplane was operated by the pilot as a familiarization flight. The commercial pilot and sole passenger were not injured. The airplane departed the Upland-Cable Airport, California, about 1145. The pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight was a familiarization flight for a new member of their chapter of the Commemorative Air Force. The flight departed the Cable airport and flew east along the mountains, headed to San Bernardino. They contacted the San Bernardino tower and were instructed to enter the crosswind for runway 24. As part of the before landing checklist, the pilot turned on the carburetor heat and switched the fuel tank selector to the right fuel tank. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. The pilot attempted numerous times to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful. The pilot realized that he would not be able to reach the airport, and decided to make a forced landing to a small field in a residential area. During the landing approach, the airplane contacted a power line. After touching down in the field the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage.During the postaccident examination of the airplane, about 16 ounces of water were removed from the fuel system.  Water was present in the lower gascolator, the fine fuel filter (upper gascolator), and subsequent fuel line to the carburetor inlet.  A brass screen at the carburetor inlet and 2 carburetor fuel bowl thumb screens also contained corrosion, water, and rust.  The approved aircraft inspection checklist called for washing the carburetor and main fuel filter every 50 hours and cleaning and/or replacing the fine fuel filter every 100 hours.  The fine fuel filter is not easily accessible and not able to be drained during a preflight inspection. The mechanic who completed the most recent inspection stated that he did not drain or check the fine fuel filter.

The crew asked ATC for permission to descend at 1910, much before their descent point, so as to keep clear of weather and avoid turbulence. The winds reported by ATC were 130° and 08 knots. As the winds were favourable for runway 07 the crew decided for a VOR approach to runway 07 via DME arc.At 1923 crew reported commencing the arc. While on final approach the crew asked for winds, ATC informed crew that the winds were 320° and 12 knots. The crew also saw tail winds on their Primary Flight Display (PFD) and decided to discontinue the approach. ATC then cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach to runway 25 from overhead. The crew then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 via the DME arc, as there was weather overhead. This was accepted by ATC at 1931. At the same time ATC also informed crew that winds were then 100° and 12 knots. The aircraft climbed 4000 feet and was kept left of the runway, keeping runway in visual contact.The crew continued with the approach and went out for 15 NM to avoid weather before turning right to intercept the ILS. The flight reported established on localizer at 1937 and was informed by ATC of moderate rain on airfield. At 1938 crew reported intercepting ILS and was cleared to land with reported winds of 13 knots at 160°. As per the statement of crew the approach was clear and runway lights could be seen from 13 NM. The runway lights and PAPI lights appeared bright and hence the crew requested ATC to reduce the intensity of the lights.As the aircraft descended through 600 feet, auto pilot was disconnected. After the aircraft touched down, it veered to the right. The PIC tried to control the aircraft using rudder to turn it to the left. However aircraft went excessively to the left. The PIC was also warned by the co-pilot about the aircraft heading. The aircraft continued going left even after application of full right rudder by the PIC.The aircraft subsequently went out of the runway into the unpaved surface on left, damaging runway edge lights, runway marking light and a taxiway edge light. The aircraft travelled approximately 180 meters on the unpaved surface while jumping a pit and crossing taxiway F near the isolation bay before coming to halt 78 meters away from runway centre line, with heading 204°.Probable cause of the AccidentImproper cross wind landing technique and failure to use nose wheel steering or differential braking after rudder efficiency was diminished due to decreasing speed caused the aircraft to veer out of runway.The runway condition was a contributory factor.07-05-201607-05-2016",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2016

The pilot suffered a minor injury, but none of the 17 skydivers on board were injured.The pilot reported that following takeoff from runway 26, he made a right turn and continued his climb for the skydive drop, however, while passing through 1,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost power. The pilot initiated a turn toward the airport, however, realized he was unable to make it, and landed in an open field. During the landing roll, the airplane exited the field, crossed E Jahant Road, impacted a truck, continued into a vineyard, and nosed over.Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the fuel pressure line that connects the fuel control unit to the airframe fuel pressure transducer was fractured below the fuel control unit fitting's swaged seat. In addition, a supporting clamp for the fuel pressure fuel line was fractured and separated. The operator reported that the fractured fuel line had been replaced the night before the accident and had accumulated about 4 hours of operational time. The previously-installed line had also fractured.Probable Cause and Findings ""A total loss of engine power due to a fatigue fracture of the fuel pressure line that connected thefuel control unit and the fuel flow transducer due to vibration as the result of a fatigue fracture of an associated support clamp. Contributing to the accident was the mechanic's inadequate inspection of the fuel line support clamp during the previous replacement of the fuel line.""",Parachuting,NTSB ,2016

The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful. At 1311 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 1347 hours.Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring.After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m. In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 135756 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer ""Yes, its getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive.The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked.At 135942 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway 280° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec.While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters.Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment.At 140014 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll.At 140042 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h.While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital.18-05-201619 July 1963CCCP-11408Soviet Air Force25 Sept. 1986CCCP-11408Soviet Air Force15 Nov. 1991CCCP-11408MAP Omsk APO12 Nov. 1993RA-11408Aviaobshchemash1995RA-11408Sky Cabs Air Cargo9 April 1998RA-11408Aerofreight AirlinesNov. 2003RA-11408Avial NVMarch 2004RA-11408Aerofreight AirlinesJuly 20044K-AZ56Silk Way2006UR-CAFShovkoviy ShlyahSept. 20154K-AZ25Silk Way",Ferry/positioning,,2016

Scheduled departure time was 2245 hours. Destination of the flight was Cairo, Egypt.Last contact with the flight was at FL370, about 0229 hours. According to Greek military authorities their primary radar showed the aircraft suddenly taking a 90 degree turn left, followed by a 360 degrees turn in the opposite direction as it descended from FL370 to FL150 before disappearing off radars.The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were both recovered from the sea bed on June 16, 2016. The Egyptian authorities found that- The flight recorders stopped operating while the aircraft was in cruise at an altitude of 37,000 feet;- The aircraft systems sent ACARS messages indicating the presence of smoke in toilets and the avionics bay;- The data from the data recorder confirms these messages;- The playback of the cockpit voice recorder reveals, in particular, that the crew mentioned the existence of a fire on board;- Several pieces of debris were retrieved from the accident site. Some of these had signs of having been subject to high temperatures, and traces of soot.On December 15, 2016, investigators reported that traces of explosives were found on several victims. Egyptian authorities determined that there had been a malicious act. The formal investigation per ICAO Annex 13 was stopped and further investigation fell within the sole jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.Contradicting the Egyptian finding, the French BEA considered that the most likely hypothesis was that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aircraft was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aircraft.19-05-201619-05-2016",International Scheduled Passenger,,2016

The airplane stopped on the runway at the intersection C5, about 1500m down of 3360m long runway , with spread debris and trace of the brakes in the last 700m. The flight crew used two extinguishing bottles on engine no.1 to put out the fire. At 1243, five minutes after the aircraft came to a stop, the flight crew ordered an evacuation since they received a new fire indication for engine no.1.All 319 onboard were evacuated on the runway using emergency slides from right side doors. No serious injuries were found among 302 passengers and 17 crew members, however, 19 had medical treatments for smoke inhalation and/or bruises during evacuation, 12 sent to hospital. The accident runway were closed for five and a half hours, and three remaining runways were also closed for two hours. This incident caused more than 400 of other commercial flights to be cancelled, as well as many more diversions, delays and returns to the destination.Probable CausesIt is highly probable that the causes of this accident were the fracture of the high pressure turbine (HPT) disk of the No.1 (left-side) engine during the takeoff ground roll, the penetration of the fragment through the engine case and the occurrence of subsequent fires.Regarding the cause for the 1st stage HPT disk to be fractured, it is probable that a step was machined exceeding the allowable limit when machining U-shaped groove on the aft side of the 1st stage HPT disk to manufacture the engine and from this step the low-cycle fatigue crack was initiated and propagated during running of engine.Regarding why the step could not be found, it is somewhat likely that defects failed to be detected at the time of the inspection by the manufacturer during the production process. And as for the cracks that were not found, it is somewhat likely that those cracks failed to be detected at non-destructive inspection on the disk by the Company at the time of maintenance of the engine in use.Regarding the fire breakout from the No.1 engine, it is probable that due to the impact forces generated by the release of the fragment from the ruptured rim part of the 1st stage HPT disk through the engine case and the engine rundown loads generated when the engine stopped suddenly, the cracks were developed in the outer case of the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger and the fuel and engine oil leaking through these cracks contacted the hot area of engine cases of the No.1 engine to be ignited.27-05-2016",International Scheduled Passenger,JTSB ,2016

The aircraft, an McDonnell Douglas MD-11F cargo plane was bound for Anchorage, Alaska. The aircraft's takeoff weight was 629,600 lbs, which was below the maximum allowable take-off weight of 630,500 lbs. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 33L. The aircraft reached V1 speed after a ground run of 6413 feet. About that time the crew heard a noise, originating from the failure of the no.9 tire (the left-hand tire on the central landing gear). The no.10 tire on the same landing gear also ruptured. Vibration and torsion forces then caused the lower drag brace of the central landing gear to break. The drag brace then hit the body several times. This caused a rupture of the hydraulic system of brake system 1, reducing the total brake efficiency to about 48% as the crew rejected the takeoff. With 4,635 feet of runway remaining the aircraft began to decelerate.The aircraft required a deceleration distance of at least about 5,550ft from the position where the takeoff was rejected. As a result, the MD-11 stopped at approximately 1,591 ft (485 m) past the end of the runway 33L. The nose gear collapsed and the no. 1 and 3 engines contacted the grass.The ARAIB investigators noted that there is an inherent difficulty in determining the flight performance of an aircraft after V1 when limited information and little time is available to the crew for a go/no-go decision.The UPS flight operations manual states that after V1, rejecting takeoff is not recommended unless the captain judges that aircraft can not fly, but the manual does not establish a definition of 'non-flying'. ARAIB notes that it would be beneficial for the aviation industry to provide flight crews with definitions of 'non-flightability' and additional guidance and training as to how to judge aircraft flight performance under certain circumstances, especially after V1.CAUSE (translated from Korean)After the take-off determination speed (V1), the high-speed takeoff abandonment is performed by the tire of the central landing gear and the drag brace defect, and the runway is separated.Contributing factor is ""(1) For limited time and available information on the encountered situation,(2) Dynamic instability of dragging of central landing gear after tire failure.(3) Decrease in braking performance due to rupture of hydraulic pipe of brake system 1 "".06-06-201606-06-201606-06-201606-06-201606-06-2016",Cargo,ARAIB ,2016

The flight crew requested ATC for a pushback clearance at 0452 local time. ATC cleared the flight to line up on runway 26 by entering Taxiway N1 and backtracking. The crew requested for an intersection departure, but this was not allowed by ATC. The starboard engine was started followed by start of port engine at 0453.At 0501, as the aircraft was taxiing down th runway, ATC gave a departure clearance to the aircraft. It was cleared to Mumbai at FL220. The aircraft thereafter lined up on runway 26 after making a 180° turn at the turn pad. At 0503, flight 2374 was cleared for take-off.The crew completed the before take-off checklist and at 0503 pushed the thrust levers to increase the thrust. After the Throttle Lever Angle (TLA) had passed 40%, the pilot in command pressed the TOGA button for takeoff.As soon as TOGA was pressed, the aircraft started drifting towards the right. Within 10 to 12 seconds the aircraft went off the runway, onto the grass. The crew tried to apply brakes, rudder and use nosewheel steering to steer the aircraft. Due to heavy bumps they could not apply control effectively.The aircraft stopped at a distance of 219 m from the runway edge and just short of perimeter road. In the process it had hit PAPI lights.

The pilot and passengers attended a local sporting event before returning to the airport about 2230.At 2255 the pilot was cleared for takeoff from runway 24R and the controller instructed him to turn right to a heading of 330 degrees and maintain 2,000 feet msl after departure. The pilot acknowledged the clearance. At 225633, the engine power increased for takeoff, and 15 seconds later the airplane became airborne. The airplane entered a right turn shortly after takeoff and proceeded out over a large lake. Dark night visual conditions prevailed at the airport; however, the airplane entered instrument conditions shortly after takeoff. The airplane climb rate exceeded 6,000 fpm during the initial climb and it subsequently continued through the assigned altitude of 2,000 ft mean sea level.The flight director provided alerts before the airplane reached the assigned altitude and again after it had passed through it. The bank angle increased to about 62 degrees and the pitch attitude decreased to about 15 degrees nose down, as the airplane continued through the assigned heading. The bank angle ultimately decreased to about 25 degrees. During the subsequent descent, the airspeed and descent rate reached about 300 knots and 6,000 fpm, respectively. The enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) provided both ""bank angle"" and ""sink rate"" alerts to the pilot, followed by seven ""pull up"" warnings. The aircraft impacted the water at 225758.The Coast Guard reported it suspended the search for possible survivors on December 31. Divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder and pieces of debris on January 6, 2017.A postaccident examination of the recovered wreckage did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction.It is likely that the pilot attempted to engage the autopilot after takeoff as he had been trained. However, based on the flight profile, the autopilot was not engaged. This implied that the pilot failed to confirm autopilot engagement via an indication on the primary flight display (PFD).The PFD annunciation was the only indication of autopilot engagement. Inadequate flight instrument scanning during this time of elevated workload resulted in the pilot allowing the airplane to climb through the assigned altitude, to develop an overly steep bank angle, to continue through the assigned heading, and to ultimately enter a rapid descent without effective corrective action. A belief that the autopilot was engaged may have contributed to his lack of attention.It is also possible that differences between the avionics panel layout on the accident airplane and the airplane he previously flew resulted in mode confusion and contributed to his failure to engage the autopilot. The lack of proximal feedback on the flight guidance panel might have contributed to his failure to notice that the autopilot was not engaged.The pilot likely experienced some level of spatial disorientation due to the dark night lighting conditions, the lack of visual references over the lake, and the encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. It is possible that once the pilot became disoriented, the negative learning transfer due to the differences between the attitude indicator display on the accident airplane and the airplane previously flown by the pilot may have hindered his ability to properly apply corrective control inputs.Available information indicated that the pilot had been awake for nearly 17 hours at the time of the accident. As a result, the pilot was likely fatigued which hindered his ability to manage the high workload environment, maintain an effective instrument scan, provide prompt and accurate control inputs, and to respond to multiple bank angle and descent rate warnings.PROBABLE CAUSE ""Controlled flight into terrain due to pilot spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident was pilot fatigue, mode confusion related to the status of the autopilot, and negative learning transfer due to flight guidance panel and attitude indicator differences from the pilot's previous flight experience.""29-12-201629-12-2016",Private,NTSB ,2016

About 30 minutes into the flight, when the aircraft had climbed to 30,000 feet, the flight crew noticed that the oil quantity parameter in the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) showed 17 units for the left engine but only 1 unit for the right engine.The flight crew also noticed from the EICAS display that the right engine oil pressure was fluctuating between 65 and 70 psi while the oil temperature for the right engine was 10°C higher than the left engine. However, both the oil pressure and temperature parameters were within the normal operating range.The flight crew looked through their available manuals but was unable to find an appropriate procedure that addressed the low engine oil quantity situation.At 0304 hours, the Pilot-in-command (PIC) contacted their company's engineering control centre for assistance. The engineer informed the PIC that since the oil pressure was within the normal operating range, there could be a faulty oil quantity indication. The engineer advised the PIC to continue with the flight but monitor the right engine oil parameters. The engineer told the PIC that he would also contact the company's technical services personnel for advice.After being briefed by the engineer on the situation, the technical services personnel believed that it was a faulty oil quantity indication. As the aircraft had just departed and was not far from Singapore, the technical services personnel recommended that the aircraft return to Singapore.According to the flight crew, as they were passing waypoint VPG at approximately 0320 hrs, the First Officer performed a routine fuel quantity check. After comparing the TOTALIZER fuel quantity with the planned fuel remaining quantity, it was determined that the fuel consumption was better than expected as the fuel on board was 600 kg more than the expected value.At 0328 hrs, the engineer sent a message via the Aircraft Communication and Reporting System (ACARS) to the flight crew informing them about the recommendation by the technical services personnel for the aircraft to return to Singapore and requesting them to contact the engineering control centre.The PIC contacted the engineering control centre and a conference call among the PIC, the engineering control centre and the technical services personnel was held, which lasted for about 20 minutes. The PIC informed the rest that the flight crew had been monitoring the right engine oil parameters for 50 minutes and other than the indicated low oil quantity, the parameters appeared normal. It was jointly assessed that the flight could continue to Milan with the proviso that the flight crew monitor the right engine oil parameters and contact the engineering control centre for assistance if needed.Shortly after the conference call ended, the flight crew felt an unusual vibration in the control column and cockpit floor. The flight crew tried to diagnose the problem by changing the engine power settings and found that the vibration disappeared when the power of the right engine was reduced. At about the same time, the flight crew caught a momentary wisp of burnt smell in the cockpit but the smell disappeared quickly.At 0404 hrs, the PIC informed the engineering control centre about the vibrations which the flight crew experienced whenever the right engine was operated at higher power settings. In the ensuing conference call among the PIC, the engineering control centre and the technical services personnel, it was assessed that there was no need to shut down the right engine and decided that the aircraft would return to Singapore with the right engine operating at idle power. In the midst of the conference call, the In-flight supervisor (IFS) informed the flight crew that there was a burnt smell detected in the cabin. In response, the flight crew turned off the right engine bleed system.According to the cabin crew, the smell was particularly strong in the forward part of the aircraft. The cabin crew distributed wet towels for the passengers to hold over their nose and breathe through it. After the conference call ended, the flight crew reduced the right engine to idle power and proceeded to turn the aircraft around to return to Singapore. For the return journey to Singapore, the flight crew adopted the procedure for single engine operation, including a descent to 17,000 feet before reducing the right engine to idle power.When the IFS informed the flight crew that the burnt smell in the cabin was still present, the right air conditioning pack and recirculating fans were switched off. Shortly after, the smell in the cabin subsided.At 0521 hrs, the flight crew received a FUEL DISAGREE message on the EICAS. The flight crew performed the FUEL DISAGREE checklist. The FUEL DISAGREE checklist suggested four scenarios in which a fuel leak should be suspected and when the flight crew should perform the FUEL LEAK checklist. One such scenario is when the TOTALIZER fuel quantity is less than the CALCULATED5 fuel quantity.The flight crew observed from the display of the flight management system that TOTALIZER fuel quantity was about 79 tonnes and the CALCULATED fuel quantity was about 83 tonnes.However, the flight crew did not perform the FUEL LEAK checklist. According to the flight crew, they believed the CALCULATED fuel quantity was no longer accurate because input changes had been made to the flight management system after the right engine was set to idle power and they were no longer on the planned flight route.Thus, the flight crew performed their own fuel calculation by subtracting the amount of fuel consumed from the total amount of fuel at the start of the flight. The fuel consumed was calculated to be about 79 tonnes. As this tallied well with the TOTALIZER fuel quantity figure, the flight crew concluded that the FUEL DISAGREE message was a spurious one and that there was no need to proceed with the FUEL LEAK checklist. Several times on the return journey and as the aircraft approached Singapore, the flight crew was queried by the Air Traffic Control (ATC) if they needed any assistance. The flight crew replied that, other than the need to fly at the lower altitude of 17,000 feet, no assistance was needed as all other operations were normal.Prior to landing, the flight crew jettisoned about 41,500 kg of fuel to bring the aircraft to below its maximum landing weight.At 0649 hrs, the aircraft landed on runway 20C. About 20 seconds after the thrust reversers on both engines were deployed, the occupants in the cabin heard two loud bangs, accompanied by two flashes, originating from the right engine area. At the same time, the flight crew heard a soft thud. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting Service (ARFF) personnel who were monitoring the aircraft's arrival informed the Control Tower on seeing the fire at the right engine. The Control Tower informed the flight crew of the fire and instructed the aircraft to stop at the intersection between the runway and rapid exit taxiway E7. The flight crew did not receive any fire warning in the cockpit.The first foam tender arrived on scene after 57 seconds and started discharging foam at the right engine. The fire was eventually brought under control after about two minutes. Disembarkation commenced at 0710 hrs via a mobile stairs positioned at the front left door of the aircraft. All occupants, including the flight crew, vacated the aircraft by 0731 hrs.CONCLUSION1 The fuel leak in the occurrence flight was a result of a cracked tube within the MFOHE of the right engine. Fuel leaked into various areas of the engine through the core of the engine and the fan duct.2 When the thrust reverser was deployed during landing, the conditions at the area aft of the turkey feather seal of the core exhaust nozzle resulted in hot surface ignition of the fuel that had leaked from the MFOHE into the various areas of the right engine.3 As the fire developed, it propagated towards the forward section of the engine and entered the core of the engine through the fan booster inlet.4 The methods that were used to detect fuel leakage into the engine system by the operator and engine manufacturer were not able to detect the fuel leak that resulted from the cracked tube within the MFOHE when it occurred in that event flight.5 The engine manufacturer issued SB 79-0034 to address the issue of possible fuel leak in the MFOHE. The deadline for incorporating the SB was determined using the CAAM. The actions called for by the SB was not performed on the occurrence engine as the SB was issued after the engines last maintenance.6 In the course of the investigation, the engine and MFOHE manufacturers have identified that diffusion bonding can potentially cause any tube in the MFOHE to crack.7 The flight crew did not execute the steps in the FUEL DISAGREE checklist correctly.8 The flight crew depended on the fire commander as their sole information source when deciding whether an evacuation was needed. Several other resources which could have aided them in making their decision were not utilised.27-06-2016",International Scheduled Passenger,TSIB Singapore ,2016

The commercial pilot and 14 passengers were not injured. No flight plan was filed and local traffic advisory was requested by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions with light rain showers prevailed throughout the area. The flight originated from Baldwin Airport about 1350.According to the pilot, he had ferried the airplane from Forest Lake, Wisconsin, to Baldwin on the morning of the accident. The airplane had just completed its 100-hour inspection at Forest Lake. After flying three air drops without incident, he prepared for his fourth flight of the day. He stated that all of the previous 3 flights had successfully deployed the parachutists and were full stop landings in an empty airplane. Due to the temperatures of 90+ degrees and high humidity, the pilot requested his manifests limit to 14 parachutists and allow a longer time between shutdowns to allow for adequate cooling before the next flight. The pilot reported that pop-up rain showers had been passing north and south of Baldwin throughout the morning, but never coming closer than 10-15 miles. While preparing for the fourth flight of the day (accident flight) the pilot discussed the weather with a experienced parachutist. Clouds were currently over the intended drop zone but there was no rain and the clouds were moving away from the northern edge of the drop zone. The pilot and parachutist agreed that it was worth attempting the drop considering the cloud movement away from the drop zone. The 14 parachutists were loaded and the airplane took off. Climbing through 3,000 feet MSL, the pilot checked in with ATC for traffic advisory and a radio check. Climbing through 4,000 feet, ATC advised the pilot that light to moderate precipitation was in the area. The pilot continued to climb toward the drop zone to see if there was any rain over the area and about 1-1.5 miles from the zone, light rain was encountered. The pilot advised the parachutists that they were returning to Baldwin to land because of the weather.After descending, the pilot set up a base leg to runway 18, and about two miles from the airport, turned on final. The approach was a stabilized, powered-on approach which was much flatter than the standard descent with an empty airplane. The pilot used flaps incrementally to 30-degrees (full flaps), initiated a flare over the threshold, and touched down at 65 knots. Full reverse propeller was used and the flaps retracted during the landing rollout. When the pilot started to apply brakes he discovered that the braking action was null. The 1,950 foot-long grass runway was wet because of a recent rain shower. Because of the high temperature, humidity, full load, and trees at the end of the runway, the pilot decided to not attempt a go around. The pilot held full aft on the control yoke for aerodynamic braking, stayed in full propeller reverse, and braked as much as possible without locking the wheels up. Just before coming to a complete stop (about 5-10 mph), the airplane rolled into a ditch before a road beyond the departure end of the runway. The propeller struck the dirt and the tail, causing substantial damage to the empennage. The pilot secured the engine and all of the occupants exited the airplane.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilot's decision to land the fully loaded parachutist drop airplane on a wet grass runway that had insufficient length for the landing in high temperature conditions, which resulted in a runway overrun, when a more suitable longer runway was available at a nearby airport.""21-07-2016",Parachuting,NTSB ,2016

All 300 on board survived the accident. One fire fighter was killed during the ARFF operations.The aircraft departed Thiruvananthapuram, India at 0506 hours UTC. The captain was the pilot flying (PF), and the copilot was the pilot monitoring (PM).As the flight neared Dubai, the crew received the automatic terminal information service (ATIS) Information Zulu, which included a windshear warning for all runways.The aircraft was configured for landing with the flaps set to 30, and approach speed selected of 152 knots (VREF + 5) indicated airspeed (IAS) The aircraft was vectored for an area navigation (RNAV/GNSS) approach to runway 12L. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land, with the wind reported to be from 340 degrees at 11 knots, and to vacate the runway via taxiway Mike 9.During the approach, at 083600 UTC (1236 local time), with the autothrottle system in SPEED mode, as the aircraft descended through a radio altitude (RA) of 1,100 feet, at 152 knots IAS, the wind direction started to change from a headwind component of 8 knots to a tailwind component.The autopilot was disengaged at approximately 920 feet RA and the approach continued with the autothrottle connected. As the aircraft descended through 700 feet RA at 083622, and at 154 knots IAS, it was subjected to a tailwind component which gradually increased to a maximum of 16 knots.At 083707, 159 knots IAS, 35 feet RA, the PF started to flare the aircraft. The autothrottle mode transitioned to IDLE and both thrust levers were moving towards the idle position. At 083712, 160 knots IAS, and 5 feet RA, five seconds before touchdown, the wind direction again started to change to a headwind.The right main landing gear touched down at 083717, approximately 1,100 meters from the runway 12L threshold at 162 knots IAS, followed three seconds later by the left main landing gear. The nose landing gear remained in the air.At 083719, the aircraft runway awareness advisory system (RAAS) aural message ""LONG LANDING, LONG LANDING"" was annunciated.At 083723, the aircraft became airborne in an attempt to go-around and was subjected to a headwind component until impact. At 083727, the flap lever was moved to the 20 position. Two seconds later the landing gear lever was selected to the UP position. Subsequently, the landing gear unlocked and began to retract.At 083728, the air traffic control tower issued a clearance to continue straight ahead and climb to 4,000 feet. The clearance was read back correctly.The aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 85 feet RA at 134 knots IAS, with the landing gear in transit to the retracted position. The aircraft then began to sink back onto the runway. Both crewmembers recalled seeing the IAS decreasing and the copilot called out ""Check speed."" At 083735, three seconds before impact with the runway, both thrust levers were moved from the idle position to full forward. The autothrottle transitioned from IDLE to THRUST mode. Approximately one second later, a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) aural warning of ""DONT SINK, DONT SINK"" was annunciated.One second before impact, both engines started to respond to the thrust lever movement showing an increase in related parameters.At 083738, the aircraft aft fuselage impacted the runway abeam the November 7 intersection at 125 knots, with a nose-up pitch angle of 9.5 degrees, and at a rate of descent of 900 feet per minute. This was followed by the impact of the engines on the runway. The three landing gears were still in transit to the retracted position. As the aircraft slid along the runway, the No.2 engine-pylon assembly separated from the right hand (RH) wing. From a runway camera recording, an intense fuel fed fire was observed to start in the area of the damaged No.2 engine-pylon wing attachment area. The aircraft continued to slide along the runway on the lower fuselage, the outboard RH wing, and the No.1 engine. An incipient fire started on the underside of the No.1 engine.The aircraft came to rest adjacent to the Mike 13 taxiway at a magnetic heading of approximately 240 degrees. After the aircraft came to rest, fire was emanating from the No. 2 engine, the damaged RH engine-pylon wing attachment area and from under the aircraft fuselage. Approximately one minute after, the captain transmitted a ""MAYDAY"" call and informed air traffic control that the aircraft was being evacuated.Together with the fire captain, the first vehicle of the airport rescue and firefighting service (ARFFS) arrived at the Accident site within one minute of the aircraft coming to rest and immediately started to apply foam. Additional firefighting vehicles arrived shortly after. Apart from the captain and the senior cabin crewmember, who both jumped from the L1 door onto the detached slide, crewmembers and passengers evacuated the aircraft using the escape slides, though not all exits could be used as some slides were blown up against the aircraft. The slide at the L1 door deflated after several passengers had evacuated.Twenty-one passengers, one flight crewmember, and one cabin crewmember sustained minor injuries, and a second cabin crewmember sustained a serious injury.Approximately nine minutes after the aircraft came to rest, a firefighter was fatally injured as a result of the explosion of the center fuel tank.Causes(a) During the attempted go-around, except for the last three seconds prior to impact, both engine thrust levers, and therefore engine thrust, remained at idle. Consequently, the Aircrafts energy state was insufficient to sustain flight. (b) The flight crew did not effectively scan and monitor the primary flight instrumentation parameters during the landing and the attempted go-around. (c) The flight crew were unaware that the autothrottle (A/T) had not responded to move the engine thrust levers to the TO/GA position after the Commander pushed the TO/GA switch at the initiation of the FCOM - Go-around and Missed Approach Procedure. (d) The flight crew did not take corrective action to increase engine thrust because they omitted the engine thrust verification steps of the FCOM - Go-around and Missed Approach Procedure. Contributing Factors(a) The flight crew were unable to land the Aircraft within the touchdown zone during the attempted tailwind landing because of an early flare initiation, and increased airspeed due to a shift in wind direction, which took place approximately 650 m beyond the runway threshold. (b) When the Commander decided to fly a go-around, his perception was that the Aircraft was still airborne. In pushing the TO/GA switch, he expected that the  autothrottle (A/T) would respond and automatically manage the engine thrustduring the go-around. (c) Based on the flight crews inaccurate situation awareness of the Aircraft state,and situational stress related to the increased workload involved in flying thego-around maneuver, they were unaware that the Aircrafts main gear hadtouched down which caused the TO/GA switches to become inhibited. Additionally, the flight crew were unaware that the A/T mode had remained at IDLE after the TO/GA switch was pushed. (d) The flight crew reliance on automation and lack of training in flying go-arounds from close to the runway surface and with the TO/GA switches inhibited, significantly affected the flight crew performance in a critical flight situation which was different to that experienced by them during their simulated training flights. (e) The flight crew did not monitor the flight mode annunciations (FMA) changes after the TO/GA switch was pushed because 1. According to the Operators procedure, as per FCOM - Flight Mode Annunciations (FMA), FMA changes are not required to be announced for landing when the aircraft is below 200 ft; 2. Callouts of FMA changes were not included in the Operators FCOM - Go-Around and Missed Approach Procedures. 3. Callouts of FMA changes were not included in the Operators FCTM Go-Around and Missed Approach training. (f) The Operators OM-A policy required the use of the A/T for engine thrust management for all phases of flight. This policy did not consider pilot actions that would be necessary during a go-around initiated while the A/T was armed and active and the TO/GA switches were inhibited. (g) The FCOM - Go-Around and Missed Approach Procedure did not contain steps for verbal verification callouts of engine thrust state. (h) The Aircraft systems, as designed, did not alert the flight crew that the TO/GA switches were inhibited at the time when the Commander pushed the TO/GA switch with the A/T armed and active. (i) The Aircraft systems, as designed, did not alert the flight crew to the inconsistency between the Aircraft configuration and the thrust setting necessary to perform a successful go-around. (j) Air traffic control did not pass essential information about windshear reported by a preceding landing flight crew and that two flights performed go-arounds after passing over the runway threshold. The flight crew decision-making process, during the approach and landing, was deprived of this critical information. (k) The modification of the go-around procedure by air traffic control four seconds after the Aircraft became airborne coincided with the landing gear selection to the up position. This added to the flight crew workload as they attentively listened and the Copilot responded to the air traffic control instruction which required a change of missed approach altitude from 3,000 ft to 4,000 ft to be set. The flight crews concentration on their primary task of flying the Aircraft and monitoring was momentarily affected as both the FMA verification and the flight director status were missed.03-08-201603-08-201603-08-201603-08-201603-08-201603-08-201603-08-2016",International Scheduled Passenger,GCAA UAE ,2016

The flight was cleared to perform an ILS approach to runway 28. After clearing the flight to land, the tower controller provided the latest weather information (wind 310 degrees at 15 knots) and stated that the runway condition was wet.About 0407 hours the flight crossed the runway threshold at 140 feet AGL at a speed of 156 knots. During the flare the aircraft floated for 14 seconds between 30 and 20 feet. The aircraft touched down about 2000 m down the runway.The runway length starting at the runway 28 threshold is 9209 ft (2807m). Failing to stop at the end of the runway, the aircraft travelled 300 m across two roads, a parking lot and a highway lane before coming to rest with the nose across another highway lane.The aircraft crossed the airport perimeter fence at a speed of 109 knots.CAUSE (translated form Italian)The causes of the accident are mainly due to the human factor.In particular, the accident was caused by the exit of the runway during the landing phase, caused by the loss of situational awareness relating to the position of the aircraft with respect to the runway itself. This loss of situational awareness on the part of the crew caused a delay in contact with the runway, which occurred, at a still high speed, in a position too far to allow the aircraft to stop within the space still available.Contributing to the dynamics of the event- the commander's prior decision not to carry out the go-ahead procedure (this decision is of crucial importance in the chain of events that characterised the accident);- inadequate maintenance of flight parameters in the final phase of landing;- failure of the crew to disconnect the A/T before landing;- poor lighting conditions and the presence of storm cells with heavy rainfall at the time of the event (environmental factor), which may have contributed to the loss of situation awareness;- the attention paid by the crew to the final phase of the flight, where both pilots were intent on acquiring external visual reference and did not realise that the aircraft had flown over the runway at a high speed for 18 seconds before the touchdown;- the lack of assertiveness of the first officer in questioning the commander's decisions.Finally, it cannot be excluded that a condition of tiredness and fatigue may have contributed to the accident, even if not perceived by the crew, which may have influenced the cognitive processes, in particular those of the captain, interfering with his correct decision making process.05-08-201605-08-201605-08-201605-08-201630 Oct. 1991VH-TJLBoeing12 Nov. 1991VH-TJLAustralian Airlines31 Oct. 1993VH-TJLQantas5 Dec. 2014N939NZAirwork19 Oct. 2015HA-FAXASL Airlines Hungary",Cargo,ANSV ,2016

A safe diversion was carried out.The airplane departed New Orleans International Airport, Louisiana at 0910 hours local time for a flight to Orlando International Airport, Florida. While climbing through FL310, about 26 km south off Biloxi, the air inlet cowl of the nr.1 engine broke away. The flight contacted Houston Center about 0922, stating ""engine failure...we've lost number one engine, we're descending"". Initially the flight was cleared down to FL260. The flight then radioed ""472 we need get down below ten"". The flight was then cleared down to FL240 and the flight again stated that they needed to get down to 10000 feet.While descending the crew made two unintentional transmissions to Houston Center in which they can be heard working the related emergency checklist with a sound indicating the possible use of oxygen masks by the crew.The flight then diverted to Pensacola were it landed about 0940. After landing damage was observed to the left hand wing root, a 5-inch by 16-inch hole in the fuselage and dents in the left hand horizontal stabilizer leading edge.The NTSB on September 12 reported the following initial findings from the engine examination include- One fan blade separated from the fan disk during the accident flight and - The root of the separated fan blade remained in the fan hub; however, the remainder of the blade was not recovered.- The fracture surface of the missing blade showed curving crack arrest lines consistent with fatigue crack growth. The fatigue crack region was 1.14-inches long and 0.217-inch deep, - The center of the fatigue origin area was about 2.1 inches aft of the forward face of the blade root. No surface or material anomalies were noted during an examination of the fatigue crack origin using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.Probable Cause A low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 23, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the fan case. This impact caused the fan blade to fracture into fragments that traveled farther than expected into the inlet, which compromised the structural integrity of the inlet and led to the in-flight separation of inlet components. A portion of the inlet struck the fuselage and created a hole, causing the cabin to depressurize.27-08-201627-08-201627-08-201627-08-2016",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2016

He further stated that he elected to continue the approach and prepare for a no-flaps landing. The performance charts for the aircraft were consulted and preparations were made for the landing. Both pilot claimed landing gears were selected to the down and locked position and three green lights confirming gears locked was noted. They further claimed that it was only upon touch down did they realize the gears were in fact, not down and locked when they started seeing the propeller disintegrate.Eyewitnesses reported that the undercarriage was up during the entire approach.Findings- The flight crew failed to extend the landing gear as required prior to a landing.- The GPWS warning system was unserviceable- The flaps were inoperative- Unknown distractions existed during the approach and landing that may have contributed to distract the pilot resulting in the aircraft landing with the landing gear in the retracted position.- Both pilots gave differing and varying accounts of what occurred, and what actions they took on the flight deck prior to the gear up landing.- Analysis of the CVR uncovered a possible intentional complete dump of the information contained on the CVR equipment.30-09-2016",Passenger,AAID Bahamas ,2016

The aircraft departed Manila Airport, Philippines at 0933 UTC (1733 LT). On board were 124 passengers and 13 crew members. The first officer was undergoing initial operating experience. He was Pilot Flying while the instructor captain was Pilot Monitoring.The en route part of the flight was uneventful. During descent towards Taipei, the flight was cleared for a SIGANG 1B RNAV STAR2 arrival. During the approach the captain suggested the first officer to use maximum thrust reverser during landing.At an altitude of 779 feet the first officer disengaged the auto pilot and continued to fly manually, with autothrust engaged.At 1128 UTC (1928 LT) the aircraft touched down on runway 23 at Taoyuan International Airport. The first officer selected thrust reversers while the aircraft was still in a 3.9°nose up attitude. The instructor pilot was apparently unhappy with the aircraft attitude and decided a go around was necessary. He stated ""i have control"", and pressed the sidestick priority pushbutton to take over control. He was unaware at that moment that the thrust reversers had been selected. He pushed the TOGA button, after which the ground spoilers were stowed and the automatic brake were released. Also, the thrust reversers returned to the stowed and locked position. The aircraft reached a nose up attitude of 14.4° and the tail struck the runway. The aircraft then became airborne.Due to changing weather circumstances the airport changed the active runway to 05R. Meanwhile the flight had entered a holding at 4100 feet. The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 05R and at 1944 LT the flight crew declared an emergency (PAN PAN PAN). At 1959 the aircraft landed on runway 05R. After the aircraft landed the flight operation department of Taoyuan Airport carried out a runway inspection of runway 23, finding strike marks and aircraft debris. It was then decided to close the runway. The belly structure of the aircraft suffered skin damage.Findings related to probable causes1. The attention allocation and situational awareness of the Instructor Pilot were probably affected by the training Captains nose-holding tendency after touchdown addressed in the training record, so that he focused too much on the aircrafts attitude but neglected to monitor critical information during landing as a pilot monitoring should do.For this reason, the Instructor Pilot was neither aware of the ""REV"" indication on the Engine/Warning Display page nor the position of reverse thrust levers, thus as a result neither held the status of thrust reverser in hand nor used it to make decision on whether to continue or reject the landing while taking over the flight control.2. In order to get the aircraft airborne promptly, the Instructor Pilot pulled the side stick full back after taking over the flight control and held that position until the aircraft started to rotate. In the mean time, forward thrust was unable to increase at once since thrust reversers were not in stowed and locked position yet, and the air speed continued to drop while deceleration devices kept functioning.Subsequently under the combination effects of deceleration devices stopped functioning, engine power sharply increased, and the pitch trim position was higher than normal setting, the Instructor Pilots full back side stick input caused the aircraft to pitch up rapidly. Though the Instructor Pilot had released the side stick input accordingly, however it didnt overcome the dramatic pitch up tendency. The excessive rotation rate and high pitch during lift-off then led to the loss of tail section clearance, the tail strike, and the damage to the aircraft.",International Scheduled Passenger,ASC ,2016

All three occupants died in the crash.Flight 3153 had originated in Bethel, Alaska; made scheduled stops in Togiak and Quinhagak; and was scheduled to return to Togiak before returning to Bethel, the intended final destination for the day. The aircraft departed Quinhagak at 1133.An area believed to be the initial impact point was discovered on the northwest side of a mountain ridgeline at the 2300-foot level. The initial impact point was located north of and about 200 feet below the 2500-foot mountain summit and contained fragmented portions of fuselage and two severed propeller blades. From the initial impact point, the wreckage path extended southeast to the main wreckage, which was located downslope on the southeast side of the ridgeline at the 1,550-foot level. The outboard portion of the left wing had separated and was located about 200 feet further downslope below the main wreckage site. A postcrash fire incinerated a large portion of the fuselage and right wing.PROBABLE CAUSE The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crews decision to continue the visual flight rules flight into deteriorating visibility and their failure to perform an immediate escape maneuver after entry into instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Contributing to the accident were (1) Hagelands allowance of routine use of the terrain inhibit switch for inhibiting the terrain awareness and warning system alerts and inadequate guidance for uninhibiting the alerts, which reduced the margin of safety, particularly in deteriorating visibility;(2) Hagelands inadequate crew resource management (CRM) training; (3) the Federal Aviation Administrations failure to ensure that Hagelands approved CRM training contained all the required elements of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 135.330; and (4) Hagelands CFIT-avoidance ground training, which was not tailored to the companys operations and did not address current CFIT-avoidance technologies.02-10-201602-10-2016",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2016

There were no other persons on board besides the crew.Flight preparation, aircraft loading and taxiing from the stand to take-off position were uneventful.Taxiing distance was about 800 m. The aircraft took off on runway 03 at 1930	LT. The weather was good and it was starting to become dark at that time in the evening. When the landing gear was retracted, the GEAR UNLOCKED warning light and the HYD PRESS ON indicator for the hydraulic system remained on. At the pilot-in-command's request, the co-pilot selected gear back down, and the three green lights indicating that the gear was down and locked illuminated normally. The HYD PRESS ON indicator and GEAR UNLOCKED warning were also extinguished as usual.The pilot-in-command continued flying towards Oulu, and the co-pilot searched the emergency checklists for suitable procedures for the situation. Any procedures directly applicable to this malfunction were not found, but the pilots decided to follow the procedure for cases where the HYD PRESS ON light remained on continuously. The procedure assisted in isolating the fault to the landing gear system, but the exact nature of the malfunction was not clear. The pilots took the actions as instructed, except that the point ""landing gear switch	-	rapidly recycle"" was omitted, since the gear was already extended and the indicator lights showed that it was down and locked.The pilot-in-command decided to continue to Oulu with the gear down, as the procedure did not call for landing as soon as possible and the weather was good. Approach and landing at Oulu were performed in darkness at 2005. The aircraft touched down at the beginning of the runway, and the landing run was normal at first. When the plane had decelerated to	a	speed of about 60 kt,	the pilot-in-command started braking, at which time the right main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft tilted to the right. The pilot-in-command stated that he had managed to keep the plane on the runway using nose wheel steering, braking hard on the left side and applying reverse thrust in the left engine. The aircraft stopped quickly after the landing gear had collapsed, within	a	distance of about 80 m.The aircraft came to	a	stop on the right edge of runway 30, remaining well on the paved surface. The engines were running until the plane stopped and were then shut down. The pilot in-command asked the co-pilot to report the incident to the ATC and request	a	tow vehicle.After sending the report, electrical power was switched off. ATC alerted the rescue services, and the pilots exited the plane uninjured.Probable causesThe accident was caused by an installation error in the right main landing gear. Checks made during installation were inadequate, and even the final inspection of the work did not cover the correct fitting or securing of the pivot pin.The pivot pin installation procedure is not complex, and the principle is easy to understand.Working conditions were good and the mechanic who fitted the pin was fairly experienced, so a	 clear and explicit cause for the error could not be determined. Even though this phase of installation was important structurally and for flight safety, one significant possibility may be that the mechanic's concentration was not focused on the seemingly simple task.A	contributing factor to the error was that the maintenance instructions did not adequately support the correct performance and quality assurance of the work.",Cargo,AIB Finland ,2016

Destination was Belfast International Airport, Northern Ireland.As the aircraft descended through 1,000 ft in preparation for landing on runway 25 at Belfast International Airport, it was configured with flaps 30, and autopilot and auto throttle were disengaged. The calibrated airspeed was about 148 kt (VREF + 7), with a tailwind component of approximately 5 kt and crosswind component of approximately 10 kt from the left.As the aircraft descended below 500 ft, the descent rate was a nominal 800 fpm. This was maintained until about 40 ft agl when the landing flare was initiated, reducing to about 600 fpm (10 fps) at touchdown. The aircraft touched down with 1.7° of left bank and a drift angle of 3° to the right, at about 148 kt CAS (VREF + 7) and a peak recorded normal acceleration of 1.65 g.The aircraft touched down about 250 m beyond the threshold of runway 25. The speedbrakes were deployed, and subsequently the thrust reversers and the brakes were selected. The crew felt a vibration that started to increase in intensity and they suspected a tyre failure. The anti-skid fail warning illuminated, and the crew cancelled the thrust reversers and automatic braking as  sufficient runway remained in which to stop. The aircraft track continued to oscillate close to the runway centreline before stopping 2,170 m beyond the threshold of runway 25 at its intersection with runway 17/35. There were no injuries and the aircraft was moved from the runway at approximately 1900 hrs.The physical and recorded evidence indicate that the fracture to the lower torsion link on the right main landing gear leg was most likely caused by shimmy. This and previous occurrences show that the Boeing 737 main landing gear is susceptible to shimmy, particularly at higher landing speeds and for softer landings.The manufacturer has a mature and well-documented list of probable causal factors for shimmy on this aircraft type. There was no evidence of a pre-existing defect in the failed torsion link or the apex joint which would have caused the shimmy. It was not possible to assess the condition of the shimmy damper or determine if there was any freeplay in the joints associated with the torsion links. Accordingly it is possible that there was a failure of the damper or excessive freeplay in the joints, which combined with the high-speed landing may have induced shimmy.04-10-2016",Cargo,AAIB ,2016

Upon departure the visibility at the destination was reported to be 1900 meters, which was below the 4000 m minima.During the approach to Belaya Gora, the crew was able to observe the airport and visibility at the time was above minima. Then snowfall began limiting visibility at the airport.At 1630 hours, eight minutes before landing, the meteorologist issued a special weather report with a visibility of 1900 m and a wind from 350° at 5 m/s, gusts 10 m/s, moderate snow, 5-7 octas cloud layer at 330 m. This information was not passed on to the crew.The aircraft landed hard on the snowy floodplain of the Indigirka River, about 230 m to the left and 390 m short of the runway. The right hand main landing gear collapsed as the aircraft rolled out over uneven terrain, causing the propeller to separate after striking the ground. The fuselage and nose section also suffered substantial damage. The aircraft came to rest 720 m after touchdown, 350 m to the left of the runway centreline.Probable cause (translated from Russian)An aircraft accident with An-26-100 RA-26660 aircraft occurred during the day, when landing in conditions of snow and in meteorological conditions below the established minimum of the aerodrome (240x4000), which led to a crew error in the recognition of the runway with rolled snow, landing on the floodplain of the river Indigirka with significant damage to the aircraft during the run.Most likely, the accident was the result of a combination of the following factors- the lack of an ADF during an NDB approach to land;- violation by the tower controller, by not informing the crew of the actual visibility at the runway (1,900 m) below the established meteorological minimum (the dispatcher only transmitted information about the snow charge and proposed to fly over the strip);- the lack of information about the actual visibility at the aerodrome below the established meteorological minimum (the last value transmitted by the dispatcher corresponded to the minimum);- the presence of a variety of landmarks (abandoned vessels, ship cranes, fuel shipment complex, etc.) in the snow, which may have been taken by the crew for the runway markers, at a distance of 1000-730 m from the runway- a transitional period of the year and, as a consequence, the presence on the underlying surface of numerous ""bald spots"" that make it difficult to visualize and find the runway with rolled snow (for the crew this was the first flight to this aerodrome in winter conditions after the summer season);- incomplete use by the crew of navigation aids, which led to a lack of proper monitoring of the position of the aircraft relative to the glide path;- absence of conditions for visual observation from the workplace of the controller in the control tower of aircraft approaching with a heading of 71°.11-10-2016",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2016

All four occupants died in the crash.The aircraft arrived at Kelowna Airport at about 0830 in the morning from Calgary/Springbank Airport. That evening the flight was to fly back to Springbank with the pilot and 3 passengers.The pilot filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan via the MENBO and IGVEP waypoints to Calgary/Springbank, and the flight was expected to take 46 minutes at a cruise altitude of FL250.At 2126, the pilot obtained an IFR clearance from the ground controller for the KELOWNA SEVEN DEP standard instrument departure (SID) procedure for runway 34.The instructions for the Runway 34 KELOWNA SEVEN DEP SID were to climb to 9000 feet ASL, or to an altitude assigned by air traffic control (ATC), and to contact the Vancouver Area Control Centre (ACC) after passing through 4000 feet ASL. The aircraft was then to climb and track 330° magnetic (M) inbound to the Kelowna non-directional beacon (LW). From LW, the aircraft was to climb and track 330°M outbound for vectors to the filed or assigned route.At 2131, the Kelowna tower controller cleared the aircraft to take off from the intersection of runway 34 and taxiway D. The pilot acknowledged the clearance and began the take-off roll on runway 34 about 1 minute later. Radar data showed that, at 213341, the aircraft was 0.5 nautical miles (nm) beyond the departure end of the runway and was climbing at more than 4000 feet per minute (fpm) through 2800 feet ASL, at a climb angle of approximately 16°. In that time, it had deviated laterally by about 3° to the right of the 330°M track associated with the SID.At 213401, when the aircraft was 1.2 nm beyond the runway, it had climbed through 3800 feet ASL and deviated further to the right of the intended routing. The aircraft's rate of climb decreased to about 1600 fpm, and its ground speed was 150 knots. A short time later, the aircraft's rate of climb decreased to 600 fpm, its climb angle decreased to 2°, and its ground speed had increased to 160 knots.At 213422, the aircraft was 2.1 nm beyond the departure end of the runway, and it was climbing through approximately 4800 feet ASL. The aircraft had deviated about 13° to the right of the intended track, and its rate of climb reached its maximum value of approximately 6000 fpm, with a climb angle of about 22°. The ground speed was roughly 145 knots.At 213439, the aircraft was 2.7 nm beyond the departure end of the runway, passing through 5800 feet ASL, and had deviated about 20° to the right of the intended routing. The rate of climb was approximately 2000 fpm, with a climb angle of about 7°.According to the SID, the pilot was to make initial contact with the ACC after the aircraft had passed through 4000 feet ASL. Initial contact was made when the aircraft was passing through 6000 feet ASL, at 213442.ACC acknowledged the communication and indicated that the aircraft had been identified on radar. The aircraft was then cleared for a right turn direct to the MENBO waypoint once it was at a safe altitude, or once it was climbing through 8000 feet ASL. The aircraft was also cleared to follow the flight-planned route and climb to 10 000 feet ASL.At 213455, the pilot read back the clearance as the aircraft climbed through 6400 feet ASL, with a rate of climb of approximately 2400 fpm. The aircraft was tracking about 348°M at a groundspeed of about 170 knots.At 213534, the aircraft began a turn to the right, which was consistent with the instruction from the ACC. Flying directly to the MENBO waypoint required the aircraft to be on a heading of 066°M, requiring a right turn of about 50°. At this point, the aircraft was still climbing and was passing through 8300 feet ASL. The rate of climb was about 3000 fpm.The aircraft continued the right turn and was tracking through 085°M. After reaching a peak altitude of approximately 8600 feet ASL, the aircraft entered a steep descending turn to the right, consistent with the characteristics of a spiral dive.At 213547, the ACC controller cleared C-GTNG to climb to FL 250. The lack of radar returns and radio communications from the aircraft prompted the controller to initiate search activities.At 2151, NAV CANADA notified first responders, who located the accident site in forested terrain at about midnight. The aircraft had been destroyed, and all of the occupants had been fatally injured.Because there were no flight recording systems on board the aircraft, the TSB could not determine the cause of the accident. The most plausible scenario is that the pilot, who was likely dealing with a high workload associated with flying the aircraft alone, experienced spatial disorientation and departed from controlled flight shortly after takeoff. The investigation also determined that the pilot did not have the recent night flying experience required by Transport Canada for carrying passengers at night.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The aircraft departed controlled flight, for reasons that could not be determined, and collided with terrain.Findings as to risk1. If flight data, voice, and video recordings are not available to an investigation, the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety may be precluded.2. If night and instrument proficiency are not adequately maintained, a pilot may not be able to recognize an aircraft upset and respond appropriately, especially during high-workload situations, increasing the risk of loss-of-control accidents.3. If weight-and-balance documents are inaccurate, there is a risk that aircraft will be operated outside of the allowable centre-of-gravity specifications, which could affect flight stability and controllability.4. If Transport Canada does not effectively oversee private operators, this sector of aviation may be exposed to higher risks that could lead to an accident.13-10-201613-10-201613-10-201613-10-201613-10-2016",Unknown,TSB Canada ,2016

The nose landing gear collapsed and retracted after the plane entered the grassy area, due to overload fractures.Contributing factors.- Control skills - undetermined.Inadequate use of aircraft controls, particularly as regards the mode of operation of the Autothrottle in use and the non-reduction of the IDLE power levers at touch down, may have led to a conflict between pilots when performing the landing and the automation logic active during approach.In addition, the use of only one reverse (on the right engine) and placing the left throttle lever at maximum takeoff power resulted in an asymmetric thrust that contributed to the loss of control on the ground.- Attitude - undetermined.The adoption of practices different from the aircraft manual denoted an attitude of noncompliance with the procedures provided, which contributed to put the equipment in an unexpected condition non-automatic opening of ground spoilers and asymmetric thrust of the engines.These factors required additional pilot intervention (hand control), which may have made it difficult to manage the circumstances that followed the touch and led to the runway excursion.- Crew Resource Management - a contributor.The involvement of the PM in commanding the aircraft during the events leading up to the runway excursion to the detriment of its primary responsibility, which would be to monitor systems and assist the PF in conducting the flight, characterized an inefficiency in harnessing the human resources available for the airplane operation.Thus, the improper management of the tasks assigned to each crewmember and the non-observance of the CRM principles delayed the identification of the root cause of the aircraft abnormal behavior.- Organizational culture - a contributor.The reliance on the crew's technical capacity, based on their previous aviation experience, has fostered an informal organizational environment. This informality contributed to the adoption of practices that differed from the anticipated procedures regarding the management and operation of the aircraft.This not compliance with the procedures highlights a lack of safety culture, as lessons learnt from previous similar accidents (such as those in Irkutsk and Congonhas involving landing using only one reverse and pushing the thrust levers forward), have apparently not been taken into account at the airline level.- Piloting judgment - undetermined.The habit of not reducing the throttle lever to the IDLE position when passing at 20ft diverged from the procedures contained in the aircraft-operating manual and prevented the automatic opening of ground spoilers.It is possible that the consequences of this adaptation of the procedure related to the operation of the airplane were not adequately evaluated, which made it difficult to understand and manage the condition experienced.- Perception - a contributor.Failure to perceive the position of the left lever denoted a lowering of the crew's situational awareness, as it apparently only realized the real cause of the aircraft yaw when the runway excursion was already underway.- Decision-making process - a contributor.An inaccurate assessment of the causes that would justify the behavior of the aircraft during the landing resulted in a delay in the application of the necessary power reduction procedure, that is, repositioning the left engine power lever.",Cargo,CENIPA ,2016

All five crew members sustained fatal injuries. The Expediter operated on a surveillance mission for the French Ministry of Defence. The aircraft left its parking stand at 0715 and was cleared to line up and then take off at 0718 for a standard instrument departure termed SUDIK 2B. The engines were throttled to full power and the brakes released at 0719.On lift-off, the retraction of the landing gear was initiated, and the aircraft continued to increase its pitch attitude. When the pitch angle reached 34°, the aircraft entered a power-on stall and banked suddenly to the right until it was three-quarters inverted. The bank angle was reduced at the apogee of the flight path, and then the aircraft continued its flight nose down.The aircraft hit the ground with a 38° nose-down attitude, a bank angle of approximately 70° to the right and a symmetrical installed power on the two engines. A total of approximately ten seconds elapsed between lift-off and impact.The Expediter operated on a surveillance mission for the French Ministry of Defence. The aircraft had been modified several times. Flight control modifications were carried out in 1985 prior to delivery to a shell company that was known to be used by the CIA. After being acquired by CAE Aviation, new sensors were installed in 2011 along with TCAS, TAWS, extra fuel tanks and HF/UHF antennas. In 2016 old sensors were removed and new sensors and antennas were installed.The aircraft maintenance was performed in conformity with the maintenance programme by a French company in accordance with an FAA Repair Station approval. The maintenance company did not have the specific documentation for the flight controls modification carried out in 1985, which was protected under ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations).Causes of the accidentInvestigations show that a technical malfunction was the cause of the accident. This malfunction probably originated in the specific modifications of the aircraft and in the application of an inappropriate maintenance to these modifications.Three scenarios can be envisaged- rupture of the HF antenna, which then wrapped around the elevator control surface;- inadvertent activation of the SAS, countered by the pilot;- jamming of the elevator due to a technical failure in the flight control line.Given the condition of the wreckage and the absence of witness reports from the crew, only a flight data recorder could have enabled the BEA-É to confirm one of these hypotheses.However, in consideration of the factors detailed in the analysis, the hypothesis of damage to a component of the elevator control line remains the most plausible explanation.24-10-201624-10-201624-10-2016",Official state flight,BEA-É ,2016

Following the landing gear collapse, the no.1 engine pylon was severed and a significant fire erupted in that area. The aircraft came to rest on the edge of the runway, 1934 meters past the runway threshold of runway 10L. An explosion occurred some 75 seconds after the airplane came to a stop, blowing a wing panel in the air. The airport fire services arrived on scene about 1 minute and 45 seconds after the plane stopped. By then the left wing was fully engulfed in flames. The fire consumed the left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The failure of the left main landing gear (MLG) due to fatigue cracking that initiated at a corrosion pit. The pit formed in the absence of a required protective cadmium coating the cause of which could not be determined from available evidence.

This intersection is located 1120 m past the runway threshold with 2800 m runway remaining.About 1431 hours local time the captain lined up for takeoff, advanced the engines to takeoff power, and the engines achieved full takeoff command 10 seconds later. The crew had a calculated takeoff decision speed (V1) of 134 knots for the takeoff. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. According to the captain and first officer, about 2 to 3 seconds after the first officer's 80 knot call, they both heard a ""ka-boom"" sound and the airplane veered to the right. The captain estimated that they were about 110 knots when he initiated the rejected takeoff. Flight Data Recorder information indicated that the airplane reached a maximum recorded airspeed of 136 knots. The airplane was equipped with a rejected takeoff braking system and the captain described the performance of the system as an ""aggressive stop."" During the rejected takeoff the first officer announced to air traffic control (ATC) that they were stopping, at which time the controller acknowledged and reported there was a fire.After the airplane came to a stop, the crew received the first indication of a fire in the right engine when the fire light illuminated with the fire bell. The captain commanded the engine fire checklist, which included five memory items. During the operation of the checklist, the captain shut off the fuel switch for the right engine and the first officer pulled the right fire T-handle and then rotated the handle in order to discharge one of the fire bottles into the right engine. Subsequently, they began the evacuation checklist. The first officer went through each item of the evacuation checklist and the captain accomplished the items. The captain further stated that a large portion of the evacuation checklist was to depressurize the airplane; and he felt that it took a long time to depressurize. During that time, the left engine remained at idle power and he could audibly observe a commotion in the cabin. Once they were at the point in the checklist to shut down the left engine, he secured the left engine, made an announcement over the public address system to the cabin to evacuate, activated the evacuation alarm switch, completed the evacuation checklist, and exited the cockpit, at which time they observed ""a lot of smoke.""During the time from the airplane coming to a stop and the right engine being shutdown the flight attendants had begun the evacuation. Flight data recorder (FDR) information showed that between 8 and 12 seconds after the airplane came to a stop the left overwing exit door opened, followed approximately 17 seconds later by the forward left door and then approximately 4 seconds later by the forward right door. The FDR stopped recording approximately 58 seconds after the airplane came to a stop.After exiting the cockpit, the pilots were met by the lead flight attendant who informed them that the airplane had been evacuated and that everyone was off the airplane. The first officer exited via the 1L slide, followed by the flight attendant, and then the captain. Once they were on the ground the flight crew stated that the flight attendants were moving the passengers away from the airplane. Once the airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) personnel arrived the captain contacted their dispatcher and requested a total number of souls on board.All of the occupants and crew evacuated the airplane through various exits and slides. During the evacuation, one passenger received serious injuries and 19 passengers received minor injuries.Preliminary investigation results show that the right hand engine's stage 2 high pressure turbine disk fractured into at least 4 pieces. One piece went through the inboard section of the right wing, over the fuselage and into a UPS warehouse facility, 900 metres south of the runway.As a result of the uncontained engine failure, a fuel leak resulted in a pool fire under the right wing. Investigation showed that one of the fractures exhibited features consistent with fatigue cracking initiating at an internal inclusion near the forward side of the hubs inner bore. The disk had 10,984 cycles and had a life limit of 15,000 cycles.PROBABLE CAUSE The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the HPT stage 2 disk, which severed the main engine fuel feed line and breached the right main wing fuel tank, releasing fuel that resulted in a fire on the right side of the airplane during the takeoff roll.The HPT stage 2 disk failed because of low-cycle fatigue cracks that initiated from an internal subsurface manufacturing anomaly that was most likely not detectable during production inspections and subsequent in-service inspections using the procedures in place. Contributing to the serious passenger injury was (1) the delay in shutting down the left engine and (2) a flight attendants deviation from company procedures, which resulted in passengers evacuating from the left overwing exit while the left engine was still operating. Contributing to the delay in shutting down the left engine was (1) the lack of a separate checklist procedure for Boeing 767 airplanes that specifically addressed engine fires on the ground and (2) the lack of communication between the flight and cabin crews after the airplane came to a stop.28-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-201628-10-2016",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2016

The pilot, copilot, and 8 passengers were not injured. The pilot reported that the airplane's flight controls and engines were operating normally during the pre-takeoff check, and the elevator pitch trim was positioned in the ""green"" range. He stated that the airplane did not accelerate as quickly as he expected during takeoff roll. He pulled back on the control yoke to lift the airplane off the runway, but the stall warning vane sounded. The airplane was already near the end of the runway when the pilot attempted to abort the takeoff and the airplane went off the end of the runway. The pilot stated that he didn't get ""on"" the brakes or put the propellers into reverse pitch. The pilot veered the airplane to the right to avoid an instrument lighting system (ILS) structure. The left wing hit the ILS structure, and the left main gear and nose gear collapsed with both propellers contacting the ground. The airplane skidded back to the left before stopping. Once the airplane stopped, the pilot opened the cabin door and assisted the passengers in evacuating the airplane. There was no post-crash fire.PROBABLE CAUSE The pilots inadequate preflight planning, his decision to take off knowing the airplane was over its gross takeoff weight, and his failure to abort the takeoff after he realized that the airplane was not accelerating as expected, which resulted in a runway excursion.30-10-201630-10-201630-10-2016",Private,NTSB ,2016

28-NOV-2016,Avro RJ85,CP-2933,LaMia,71,near Rionegro/Med...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20161128-0,En route (ENR),Destroyed,Fuel exhaustion Forced landing outside airport,"LaMia flight 2933, an Avro RJ85, was destroyed after impacting a wooded hillside south of Rionegro/Medellín Airport, Colombia. The aircraft carried the Brazilian Chapecoense football team for a match to Medellin. Six of the 77 occupants have survived the accident. One flight attendant and four passengers survived with serious injuries and one passenger sustained minor injuries.The initial plans were for LaMia to fly the Brazilian Chapecoense football team from São Paulo, Brazil to Medellin for the first leg of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals against Atlético Nacional.A refueling stop was planned at Cobija in northern Bolivia. LaMia requested a permit to fly from the Brazilian aviation authorities, ANAC, but this was denied as there were no provisions in the current aviation agreements between Brazil and Bolivia to allow such a commercial flight. The Chapecoense team was then flown to Santa Cruz in Bolivia on a regular commercial flight. This routing caused delays to the schedule and Cobija could no longer be used to refuel because of night time closure of the airport, according to the LaMia's general director.The distance of the flight planned from Santa Cruz to Medellín was 2983 km. The flight plan of LMI2933 showed an estimated flying time of 4 hours and 22 minutes and a fuel endurance of the same time.The flight crew calculated the takeoff weight to be 41,610 kgs, which was just below the maximum takeoff weight of 41,800 kgs. Investigators believe the luggage weight was underestimated and that the actual takeoff weight was 42,148 kgs.At 2208 UTC the engines of the RJ85 were started and permission was received to taxi to runway 34 for departure. Flight LMI2933 took off from runway 34 at Santa Cruz-Viru Viru Airport at 2218 UTC.The flight initially climbed to FL280 and later, at 2354 UTC it climbed to FL300. En route the crew repeatedly spoke about the fuel calculations and the possibility of landing at Leticia or Bogotá to refuel, but it was decided to continue to Rionegro/Medellín. At 0115 UTC the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording.At 0236 hours, as the aircraft was descending through FL250, the Master Caution sounded in the fight deck, notifying the flight crew that they had 20 minutes worth of fuel left. At 0242 the Medellin Approach controller cleared the flight to continue their descent to FL210 and to head for the GEMLI RNAV point which is located about 30 km short of the runway 01 threshold at Rionegro/Medellín Airport.At the same time, a VivaColombia Airbus A320, flight FC8170 from Bogotá to San Andrés, was diverting to Rionegro/Medellín due to indications of a fuel leak. Three other aircraft were in a holding pattern at FL190, FL180 and FL170.At 0245 UTC the flight reported entering the holding at GEMLI at FL210.  Four minutes later the flight requested priority for landing because of ""problems with the fuel"". The controller then stated that she would get back with vectors to the localizer and that it would take seven minutes before they could commence their approach.The controller then cleared a preceding flight, LAN3020, to start the approach.At 0252 UTC the controller reported to LMI2933 that there was another aircraft holding below them and asked if they could hold a little while longer. The flight then responded that they had a fuel emergency and requested a final approach course and immediate descent clearance. The controller cleared the flight to turn right before it could initiate descent. She subsequently cancelled the approach clearance of LAN3020.At 0253 selected full flaps and undercarriage down and used speed brakes in their descent. Then engine no.3 automatically shut down due to fuel exhaustion, followed by engine no.4. The flight crew did not notify the controller of this, but requested permission to immediately join the localizer. The controller assumed they were still at FL210, but the flight crew stated they were already in descent.This forced the controller to issue instructions to the other aircraft in the holding pattern to manoeuvre them away from LMI2933. She warned the flight of another aircraft ahead at FL180. LMI2933 responded that the other traffic was on their TCAS above them and that they were on final approach course.At 0255 UTC engines no. 2 and no. 1 also shut down. At that time the aircraft was at 15,934 feet, 15.5 NM south of the runway 01 threshold.At 0257 the crew radioed in Spanish that they had suffered a ""total electric total eh fault with no fuel"".  The controller reported that the flight was 0,1 mile from the Rionegro VOR and stated that she could not have altitude information of the flight. LMI2933 then reported being at 9000 feet.According to the instrument approach procedure published in the SKRG AIP, the minimum altitude upon passing the Rionegro VOR is 10000 feet. During the last radio contact with the flight, the crew requested vectors for the runway. The controller stated that the flight was 8.2 miles from the runway. The aircraft impacted the top of a hillside at an elevation of about 2600 m. Part of the wreckage came to rest down the wooded hillside right next to the RNG VOR beacon, 18 km short of runway 01.Probable causesInappropriate planning and flight execution because the amount of fuel required to fly from the airport of destination to an alternate airport nor a quantity of reserve fuel nor the contingency fuel nor the minimum fuel of landing were taken into account, these fuel quantities are required by aeronautical regulations for carrying out this type of international flight like the one made by CP 2339 aircraft.Sequential shutdown of the four (4) engines while the aircraft was in descent performing a holding pattern at GEMLI as a result of the exhaustion of fuel on board.An inadequate decision-making process by the aircraft operating company management as a result of a lack of operational safety assurance.Loss of situational awareness and mistaken decision- making process by the crew who insisted on continuing a flight with an extremely limited amount of fuel. The crew was aware of the low level of remaining fuel; however, the crew members did not take the corrective actions required to land at an aerodrome and refuel, fact that would allow them to continue the flight safely.Contributing FactorsPremature configuretion of the aircraft for landing during descent in holding pattern at GEMLI since considering the absence of thrust, this configuretion affected the plane's glide distance to Rionegro airport runway.Latent deficiencies in the planning and execution of non-regular transportation flights by the aircraft operator related to insufficient supply of the required amount of fuel.Specific deficiencies in the planning of the flight involved in the accident by the aircraft operator.Lack of oversight and operational control of the flight by the Operator, it did not supervise the planning of the flight nor its execution nor it made a follow-up of the flight that would have allowed to support the crew in making decisions.Absence of timely calls for ""priority"", or declaring an ""emergency"" or others by the aircraft crew members during the flight, and especially when fuel depletion was imminent in the descent phase and when performing a holding pattern which would have alerted air traffic services to provide the necessary support.Organizational and operational noncompliance by the aircraft operator in the implementation of fuel management procedures, as it did not comply in practice with the approval of the Bolivian DGAC in the process of the company certification.Delay in the approach of CP 2933 to Rionegro runway caused by its late priority request, and late emergency declaration for fuel added to heavy traffic at RNG VOR when on holding pattern.28-11-201626 March 1999G-6-348BAe30 March 1999N523XJMesaba Airlines18 Sept. 2007EI-RJKCityJet2 Oct. 2010EI-RJKCityJet16 Oct 2013P4-LORLAMIASept. 2014YV3035LAMIAJan. 2015CP-2933LAMIA",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,Aerocivil ,2016

The First Officers read back was correct. However, one minute and 30 seconds later, as the aircraft was taxiing on Charlie, the Captain asked the First Officer ""Where we goin? Bravo?"", to which the First Officer responded affirmatively.The aircraft then turned right onto taxiway Bravo, then turned left on to the apron and taxied behind a Fly Jamaica Boeing 767 (N767WA) parked in Parking Position 3. There was a wing walker on the ramp ahead, at the tail end of Parking Position 1 near to taxiway Alpha. Another wing walker was standing by the tail of the B767 in Parking Position 3, and a marshaller was at the head of Parking Position 2.At 1136, as the B737 taxied behind the B767, the right winglet of the B737, hit the trailing edge of the B767s right elevator, cut off the tail cone and sliced through the left elevator. The B737 then came to a halt and the captain shut down the engines.Findings Causal.1. The NTHS ramp personnel were not aware of the Airside Directive forbidding the taxiing of large aircraft behind parked B767s on the International Apron.2. The CAL flight crew was not aware of the Airside Directive forbidding the taxiing of large aircraft behind parked B767s on the International Apron.3. The Airside Directive forbidding the taxiing of large aircraft behind parked B767s on the International Apron was inadequately distributed.4. After preparation of its AIRSIDE DIRECTIVE, the CJIA did not follow through with its responsibility to ensure that relevant information was transmitted to the GCAA and Jeppesen for inclusion in the AIP and the Jeppesen Charts respectively.5. The Jeppesen and AIP airport charts for CJIA did not forbid the taxiing of large aircraft behind parked B767s on the International Apron.6. The B737 First Officer erred when he misdirected the Captain to turn on taxiway Bravo, rather than taxiway Alpha.7. Wing walker C intentionally moved the safety cone placed to mark the position of the B767s tail.8. Wing walker C did not adequately monitor the track of the B737s right winglet to ensure clearance from the B767s tail.9. Wing walker B did not adequately monitor the track of the B737s right winglet to ensure clearance from the B767s tail.10. Wing walker B attempted to marshal the B737 aircraft off to the left of the yellow taxi line to avoid the B737s right winglet hitting the tail of the B767.11. Wing walker B did not give a ""Stop"" signal to the B737 in time.12. Wing walker C did not give a ""Stop"" signal to the B737 in time.13. The right hand Number 3 Windshield Panel of the B737 was not heated, and was obscured by moisture, preventing the First Officer from adequately monitoring the clearance of the right winglet from the tail of the B767.14. The right winglet of the B737 struck the elevators and tail cone of the B767.15. Wing walker C had not been adequately trained.16. The practical marshaller training by NTHS was not approved or monitored by CAL, CJIA or GCAA.17. Wing walkers/marshallers on the CJIA ramp were following an unapproved procedure of directing aircraft off the yellow line to avoid other aircraft.18. CAL and CJIA management were not aware of this unapproved procedure.19. NTHS was aware of, and condoned, this unapproved procedure.20. B737 pilots were routinely taxiing off the yellow line.21. No hazard reports regarding this unapproved procedure were made to NTHS, CJIA or GCAA.22. The dimensions of the layout of the CJIA International Apron did not meet the ICAO Recommended Standards for the aircraft it handled.23. The SMSs of CJIA and CAL were inadequate.24. NTHS had an SMS program, but it was not approved, nor was it required to be approved.25. NTHS was not certified, approved or monitored by any other organization or authority, nor was this required.26. Neither GCAA nor CJIA provided oversight of CJIA ramp operations.27. The GCAA approved the Aerodrome Manual which was deficient. This was especially so in the SMS28. GCAA inspection of records, during aerodrome inspections, was deficient as there was no demand for presentation of agreements/records between the CJIA and its clients operating at the airport.29. GCAA did not adequately assess the inherently unsafe situation existing in the dimension and layout of the international apron.",International Scheduled Passenger,GAAIU ,2016

The pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. The flight departed the San Jose International Airport, California and Pueblo, Colorado, was the destination.The commercial pilot of the jet reported that he initially requested that 100 lbs of fuel be added to both fuel tanks. During the subsequent preflight inspection, the pilot decided that more fuel was needed, so he requested that the airplane's fuel tanks be topped off with fuel. However, he did not confirm the fuel levels or check the fuel gauges before takeoff. He departed on the flight and did not check the fuel gauges until about 1 hour after takeoff. He stated that, at that time, the fuel gauges were showing about 900-1,000 lbs of fuel per side, and he realized that the fuel tanks had not been topped off as requested. He reduced engine power to conserve fuel and to increase the airplane's flight endurance while he continued to his destination. When the fuel gauges showed about 400-500 lbs of fuel per side, the low fuel lights for both wing fuel tanks illuminated. The pilot reported to air traffic control (ATC) that the airplane was low on fuel. ATC provided radar vectors to Gunnison and the airplane was cleared for the GPS-B RWY 24 approach.

All 47 on board were killed.The aircraft took off from Chitral at 1538 hours local time, bound for Islamabad. The first officer, who was undergoing route training, was Pilot Flying (PF) and the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). A third first officer who was already route cleared, was in the jump seat.The aircraft levelled off at FL135 at an Indicated Air Speed (IAS) of 186 knots about 10 minutes after takeoff. The aircraft failed to attain the expected cruise speed of 230 knots.The flight remained uneventful till 160455. While the captain was engaged in a passenger announcement, the Propeller Electronic Control of the left side propeller (PEC-1) Single Channel fault appeared, followed by PEC-1 Fault. The captain interrupted the announcement and asked for the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) with abnormal procedures. The first officer asked to bring the power back and asked the captain to call the engineer, who was travelling as a passenger, to the cockpit. Reduction in power resulted in a gradual drop in the IAS to 146 knots. The flight crew attempted to rectify the fault using the checklist, but all three attempts to reset the PEC failed.The no.1 propeller blade pitch angle was not under the control of the PEC anymore. The blade pitch angle increased and there was an unusual decrease in the propeller speed. No. 1 propeller speed (Np-1) decreased from a normal in flight value of 82% to 62%.At 160726, the first officer cautioned about the decreasing airspeed and as a result both power levers were advanced. The IAS gradually started to increase to over 160 knots. The trainee first officer in the right-hand seat then changed seats with the other first officer. The engineer had by then joined the crew on the flight deck to help troubleshoot the issue. Despite discussing the problem, the pilots and engineer were uncertain of the origin of the fault and what to do about it. At 161033, at an airspeed of about 196 knots, a transient sound was heard, which was followed by a sudden abnormal noise. The no.1 engine torque dropped from 75% to 0% and the propeller speed (Np-1) increased rapidly from 61.5% to 102%. Additionally the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) increased. The torque reducing to zero meant that the no.1 engine had failed. However, Np-1 increasing rapidly to 102% and an increase in ITT were unusual.The flight crew then started actions to accomplish for an engine flame out. An immediate action for an engine flame out was to retard power of the effected engine. However, the captain had retarded both power levers.The rotating no.1 propeller caused drag and an asymmetric condition, more than what is usually expected in single engine flight envelope. This drag was estimated to be three times more than the value that is experienced during a usual single engine flight envelope when the propeller is in feathered position. The IAS continued to decrease to 154 knots as the pilots worked the check list. The flight crew attempted to feather the propeller, and power on engine no.2 was increased.At 161119, the captain asked the first officer to request a lower altitude (7500 ft AMSL) and issue a Mayday call. The Np-1 propeller speed stayed below 25%, a value similar to that expected for a feathered propeller, for about 40 to 45 seconds. Subsequently Np-1 started to increase again. Initially at a slow rate and then at a very fast rate from about 50% to 120-125% in 8 seconds. The first officer requested a lower altitude, changed over to Islamabad Approach, reported at position TYPO, but failed to make the Mayday call. All protections of the propeller control had apparently failed as the propeller blade pitch angle decreased further. The blade pitch angle reaching low values at a high rotational speed generated immense drag. The captain was alarmed by the sound made by the increase in propeller speed and changed the power setting for engine no.2 to check if that had any effect on the noise, which it didn't. At 161214 the Auto-Pilot (AP) disengaged as it was no longer able to cope with the drag to maintain the target aircraft parameters. Control inputs by the captain were not enough to maintain direction. With further reduction in IAS to about 120 knots, the control input requirement increased and the captain was unable to counter the left-hand turn of the aircraft.The flight crew attempted to feather the propeller again, but were not successful. The state of engine no.1 and its propeller was very unusual. It was not possible for the cockpit crew to understand the nature and extent of the technical malfunctions.Due to the substantial drag caused by the no.1 propeller and the low power setting, the aircraft was just short of a stalled condition. At 161236 the stall warning sounded and the stick shaker activated briefly. Power on engine no.2 was advanced, coupled with excessive right rudder input to counter the asymmetric condition. At 161244 this coincided with an abrupt drop in the propeller speed. A considerable amount of drag was suddenly eliminated from the left side of the aircraft, causing a immediate yaw to the right side, with the aircraft entering into a stalled flight condition. During this rapid descent and a roll the aircraft lost about 5100 ft altitude to 8350 ft AMSL. The aircraft first rolled right by about 360° and then further rolled by another about 90° and then subsequently rolled left to a wings level state. Control had been regained but the flight crew was emotionally shaking by this event.Np-1 had stabilized lower than 5%, and the blade pitch angle was at low pitch. At this position the generated drag value was around 2,000 lbf, which was about seven times more than the drag a propeller can usually produce in feathered state during a single engine flight. The aircraft was unable to fly a level flight and could only fly in a gradual descent profile. Directional control was only possible with substantial right rudder and right aileron inputs.The flight crew contacted the approach controller and requested shorter vectors with priority landing at Islamabad Airport along with a Mayday calls. After 161720 the aircraft started to turn left again with an aim to reach Islamabad Airport. While the power lever was advanced to 81.7°, and the torque was 99.8%, the IAS had gradually decreased to 156 knots. A gradually reducing control effectiveness, and an excessive drag of the left side of the aircraft, resulted in a corresponding increase in control input requirement. At 161845 the stall warning horn sounded again for 3.5 seconds. The aircraft altitude and IAS kept on decreasing to 4809 ft AMSL (2168 ft AGL) and 128 knots, and kept turning left with progressively increasing right control inputs from the cockpit crew. At 161852 the Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS) alarm began to sound. At 162023 the aircraft was continuously turning left, with progressively increasing right control inputs. The IAS was reducing through 120 knots and the aircraft stalled at 850 ft AGL. It impacted the side of a mountain and disintegrated.The investigation revealed that the sequence of events was initiated with the dislodging of one turbine blade of Power Turbine Stage (PT-1) of engine no. 1 due to fatigue. According to a Service Bulletin these turbines blades were to be changed after completion of 10,000 hours, on immediate next maintenance opportunity. The engine in question was under maintenance on November 11, 2016, and at that time these blades had completed 10004 hours and were thus due for a change. This action was not accomplished.The aircraft flew approximately 93 hours after this maintenance activity before it crashed on December 7.Probable Causes of Occurrence.9. Probable Primary Factors.(a) The dislodging / fracture of one PT-1 blade of No 1 Engine triggered a chain of events. Unusual combination of fractured / dislodged PT-1 blade with two latent factors caused off design performance of the aircraft and resulted into the accident.(b) The dislodging / fracture of PT-1 blade of No 1 Engine occurred after omission from the EMM (Non-Compliance of SB-21878) by PIA Engineering during an unscheduled maintenance performed on the engine in November 2016, in which the PT-1 blades had fulfilled the criteria for replacement, but were not replaced.(c) Fracture / dislodging of PT-1 blade in No 1 Engine, after accumulating a flying time slightly more than the soft life of 10,000 hrs (ie at about 10004.1 + 93 hrs) due to a known quality issue. This aspect has already been addressed by re-designing of PT-1 blades by P&WC.Probable Contributory Factors.(a) A fractured pin (and contamination inside the OSG), contributed to a complex combination of technical malfunctions. The pin fractured because of improper re-assembly during some unauthorized / un-documented maintenance activity.

As the flight approached Kabul, the crew received the automatic terminal information service (ATIS) at 0745 UTC indicating normal weather with visibility of 6 km, temperature +7 degrees Celsius and wind of 150° at 7 knots.The aircraft was configured for landing with the flaps set to 30, and approach speed selected of 152 knots (Vref + 10) indicated airspeed (IAS). The aircraft was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 29. The aircraft was vectored by the radar controller for runway 29. Air flight was cleared to land, with the wind reported to be 190 degrees at 15 knots.The crew stated that a few seconds after the touchdown, they felt the aircraft vibrating, during which they applied brakes and deployed the reverse thrust. The vibration was followed by the aircraft rolling slightly low to the right. It later came to a full stop left of the runway centre line, resting on its left main landing gear and the right engine, with the nose landing gear in the air.The captain declared an emergency to ATC and the crew initiated an evacuation from the left side of the aircraft. Evacuation was successfully accomplished with no reported injuries.Kabul ARFF reached the occurrence aircraft and observed the smoke coming from right side and immediately deployed their procedures by spraying foam on engine no. 2.The aircraft sustained substantial damage due to the separation of the right main gear resulting in the aircraft skidding on the right engine cowlings.CAUSEThe Investigation committee determines that the airplane occasionally experienced main landing gear shimmy and the most probable cause indicated that the struts were extended for long period of time. As a result, the torsion link of the shimmy damper remained in an extended vertical position, where the damper has less mechanical advantage for longer periods of time. Despite the presence of shimmy damper hardware which is designed to reduce the torsional vibration energy generated during landing.CONTRIBUTING FACTORS- High altitude airport of 5877 feet- An overly soft landing, allows the landing gears to remain in the air mode longer, which makes them more vulnerable to shimmy- Touchdown with a closure rate of 1 fps, which is considered overly soft and may increase the risk of shimmy torsional forces- High ground speed at touchdown of 178 knots ,which resulted from the high touchdown airspeed of 158 knots , touchdown at (VREF+16)",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAID Jordan ,2016

On board the aircraft were the pilot and two passengers.On arrival at Moomba at about 1250, the pilot configured the aircraft to join the circuit with flaps set to the approach setting and the propeller speed set at 1900 RPM. He positioned the aircraft at 150-160 kt airspeed to join the downwind leg of the circuit for runway 30, which is a right circuit. The pilot lowered the landing gear on the downwind circuit leg. He then reduced power to start the final descent on late downwind abeam the runway 30 threshold, in accordance with their standard operating procedures.At about the turn point for the base leg of the circuit, the pilot observed the left engine fire warning activate. The pilot held the aircraft in the right base turn, but paused before conducting the engine fire checklist immediate actions in consideration of the fact that they were only a few minutes from landing and there were no secondary indications of an engine fire. After a momentary pause, the pilot retarded the left engine condition lever to the fuel shut-off position, paused again to consider if there was any other evidence of fire, then closed the firewall shutoff valve, activated the fire extinguisher and doubled the right engine power.The pilot continued to fly the aircraft in a continuous turn for the base leg towards the final approach path, but noticed it was getting increasingly difficult to maintain the right turn. He checked the engine instruments and confirmed the left engine was shut down. He then adjusted the aileron and rudder trim to assist controlling the aircraft in the right turn. The aircraft became more difficult to control as the right turn and descent continued and the pilot focused on maintaining bank angle, airspeed (fluctuating 100-115 kt) and rate of descent.Due to the pilot's position in the left seat, he was initially unable to sight the runway when starting the right turn. The aircraft had flown through the extended runway centreline when the pilot sighted the runway to the right of the aircraft. The aircraft was low on the approach and the pilot realised that a sand dune between the aircraft and the runway was a potential obstacle. He increased the right engine power to climb power (2,230 foot-pounds torque) raised the landing gear and retracted the flap to reduce the rate of descent. The aircraft cleared the sand dune and the pilot lowered the landing gear and continued the approach to the runway from a position to the left of the runway centreline.The aircraft landed in the sand to the left of the runway threshold and after a short ground roll spun to the left and came to rest. There were no injuries and the aircraft was substantially damaged.Contributing factors- The operator did not modify the aircraft to include a more reliable engine fire detection system in accordance with the manufacturers service bulletin, and as subsequently recommended by the Civil Aviation Safety Authoritys airworthiness bulletin. The incorporation of the manufacturers modification would have reduced the risk of a false engine fire warning.- During the approach phase of flight, the pilot shutdown the left engine in response to observing a fire warning, but omitted to feather the propeller. The additional drag caused by the windmilling propeller, combined with the aircraft configuration set for landing while in a right turn, required more thrust than available for the approach.Other factors that increased risk- The advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to the operator, that differences training was acceptable, resulted in the pilot not receiving the operators published B200 syllabus of training. The omission of basic handling training on a new aircraft type could result in a pilot not developing the required skilled behaviour to handle the aircraft either near to or in a loss of control situation.",Ambulance,ATSB ,2016

The operator's contracted maintenance organisation completed a routine daily check on the aircraft that evening. This included checking the oil content of the No 1 engine, accessed by opening the outboard main access panel on the engine nacelle. The check was concluded by approximately 2115 hrs, with the aircraft scheduled to return to service for a 0610 hrs departure the next morning. The aircraft Technical Log entry for the daily check was signed by the engineer at 0010 hrs. The operating flight crew arrived at the aircraft at 0530 hrs and began their normal pre-flight checks. At 0550 hrs, in accordance with company procedures for the first flight of the day, the commander conducted the pre-departure inspection. As it was still dark, he used a torch to supplement the ambient airport lighting during his inspection. He did not identify any issues with the aircraft and the crew continued with their normal departure routine.The ground crew, who were responsible for pushing the aircraft back off the stand, subsequently arrived and conducted their own walkaround check of the aircraft, also identifying nothing of note. The aircraft was dispatched on time and taxied to runway 23R for takeoff.At approximately 0624 hrs the aircraft commenced its takeoff roll and then continued on an apparently uneventful flight to Hannover, Germany, landing there at 0752 hrs. After the aircraft had parked on the stand and the passengers had disembarked, the ground crew informed the cabin crew that a panel was missing from the No 1 engine. The message was relayed to the flight crew, who inspected the aircraft prior to contacting the operator's maintenance control department. The operator informed Manchester Airport operations staff at 0836 hrs, who then conducted an inspection of runway 23R. The panel was recovered from a grass area to the side of the runway, approximately 440 m from the runway threshold.Sections of the panel hold-open strut were also recovered from the runway and adjacent paved areas in the same vicinity.ConclusionFollowing overnight maintenance work, the outboard engine main access panel on the No 1 engine was not securely closed by the engineer, due to the latch bolts not engaging in the nacelle receiving features when the latches were closed. Contributory factors may have been a slight mismatch in the closure of the panel and the technique used by the engineer of closing the top latches first. The resulting gap around the panel was not identified by the engineer completing the task, possibly as a consequence of the angle at which he was looking down on the closed panel and the lack of contrast of the shadow cast on the dark coloured engine nacelle. The aircraft commander did not identify the incorrect closure of the panel during his subsequent pre-departure inspection, neither did the ground operations crew dispatching the aircraft. During the next takeoff, the panel failed at the hinge attachment points and departed the aircraft striking and damaging the vertical stabiliser, before coming to rest on the runway and its grass verge. The investigation identified a lack of consistency in the way flight crew were instructed on completing pre-departure inspections during their training. A previous accident, where the same engine panel was lost during takeoff, had occurred on the aircraft a month earlier. The circumstances and investigation findings for both accidents were the same. Safety action has been taken by the aircraft manufacturer to add labelling and amend the AMM and the operator has revised its maintenance procedures. In addition, two Safety Recommendations have been made relating to flight crew pre-departure inspection procedures and dissemination of safety information to ground crew, with the intention of preventing recurrence.14-12-201614-12-2016",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2016

One of the six crew members survived the accident.The aircraft arrived at Puerto Carreño at 1448 hours local time after a cargo flight from Bogotá. Some 20,423 pounds of cargo was offloaded and new cargo was loaded for the return leg to Bogotá. Meanwhile, at 1500 hours the aircraft became uncontrolled as had been published per Notam.In the minutes before the planned departure, a Cessna 208 and an Embraer ERJ-170 passenger plane took off from runway 07. The wind at the time was about 010 degrees at 8 knots. Subsequently the Boeing 727 taxied onto the runway, backtracking to the runway 25 threshold. At the same time the crew worked the respective checklists prior to takeoff and made a blind radio transmission, stating their imminent departure from Puerto Carreño. The aircraft then made a 180° turn and aligned for takeoff. Flaps were set at 30°and 6½ elevator trim units were selected. The flight crew then noted that they did not know the direction and intensity of the wind.Takeoff was commenced at 1718 hours. After travelling the entire length of the 1800 m long runway, the aircraft had not become airborne. It travelled another 95 meters over grass until it struck a section of the perimeter fence. It crossed a road, hit a shed and a tree. The aircraft became airborne, but as a result of the impact, the right hand main landing gear had separated, the trailing inboard right flap was damaged, a loss of power in engine no.3 occurred and a leakage of hydraulic fluid from System A was noticed by the crew.The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 790 feet and entered a slight right hand descending turn until it impacted flat terrain, bursting into flames.The weight and balance manifest of the accident flight was not found among the remains of the aircraft, nor was a copy of it in the company's office. It is presumed that the aircraft took off from Puerto Carreño with 19,820 pounds distributed on 9 pallets. According to the flight plan, there were five persons on board. In fact there was a sixth person on the flight.A video posted on Youtube in October 2016 shows a takeoff of an Aerosucre Boeing 727 at Puerto Carreño Airport barely clearing the perimeter fence.Probable causesInadequate flight planning by the operator of the aircraft, and by the crew, by failure to properly perform dispatch procedures, take-off performance calculations and verification of limitations imposed by operational conditions of the aerodrome according to the configuration of the aircraft.Wrong crew decision making by not considering a key aspect affecting aircraft performance, such as the prevailing tailwind at take-off.Erroneous selection of take-off speeds V1/VR and V2, by the crew, corresponding to an aircraft without modification in its flap system, which led to rotate the aircraft with five more knots of speed, increasing the takeoff run.Erroneous rotation technique applied by the Pilot, delayed maneuver that extended the long takeoff run even more.Loss of components (landing gear, trailing inboard flap right) and damage to functional systems (loss of engine power No.3 and hydraulic system) necessary to control the aircraft in flight.Loss of control in flight generated by asymmetries of lift, power and emptying of the main hydraulic systems that exceeded the capacity of the crew and made it impossible to maintain adequate directional control and stability of the aircraft.Contributing FactorsNon-compliance with the Aeronautical Regulations by the operating company of the aircraft, operating to an aerodrome unsuitable for the operation of B727-200 equipment, which, in addition, was not authorized for that type of aircraft in the company's Operating Specifications, approved by the Aeronautical Authority.Lack of standardization and supervision of the operating company of the aircraft, allowing the operation of the B727-200 equipment, to which a modification had been applied to the flap system, with the reference tables of speeds corresponding to the aircraft without modification.Execution of take-off with a weight that exceeded the maximum value established in the aircraft performance charts for the conditions prevailing at the Germán Olano airport.Omission of the crew by not activating the Standby hydraulic system, which might have allowed emergency hydraulic pressure, to regain control of the aircraft.Lack of supervision by the Aeronautical Authority, which allowed for several years the operation of equipment B727-200 of the company operating the aircraft at the Germán Olano aerodrome in Puerto Carreño, when the characteristics of the aerodrome did not allow it and without the operator being authorized to operate equipment B727-200 in that aerodrome.20-12-201620-12-201620-12-201620-12-201622 August 19756Y-JMABoeing29 August 19756Y-JMAAir Jamaica17 June 19846Y-JMAAir JamaicaJanuary 1985VR-CMAAir Jamaica29 Sept. 19876Y-JMMAir JamaicaJan 1997N281KHKitty Hawk Aircargo10 Jan 2008HK-4544Aerosucre20 December 2016HK-4544Aerosucre",Cargo,Aerocivil ,2016

The two pilots were not injured. The airplane was registered to Zoom Aviation, LLC, and operated by Pinnacle Air Charter, LLC. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument rules flight plan. The flight originated from Tucson International Airport, Arizona at 1532.The pilot reported that, during the approach to Scottsdale, the nose landing gear light was red, which indicated that it was not down and locked. In order to assess the situation, the pilot exited the traffic pattern, and referred to the emergency checklist. After using the hand pump to lower the landing gear manually, the red light still indicated that the gear was up. The pilot asked the tower for a landing gear check and the tower replied that it appeared it was down and straight. The pilot executed a normal landing, and as the airplane started to slow down, about 35-40 knots, the nose gear collapsed.

Three crew members and six passengers were on board the airplane.At 0720 UTC the airplane reached cruise level FL340. After entering Indian airspace (Mumbai FIR) the aircraft was cleared to fly to reporting point KITAL via route L894. At approximately 0818 UTC the co-pilot radioed reaching reporting point GOLEM.At 0655 UTC an Airbus A380-861 (A6-EUL) had taken off at Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates, for flight EK412 to Sydney, Australia. The aircraft flew at FL350 with a southern heading.At 083807 UTC the A380 had passed the Challenger overhead with a vertical distance of 1,000 ft.At 083854 UTC the Challenger, with engaged autopilot, began to slightly roll right. At the same time a counter-rotating aileron deflection was recorded and fluctuation of the vertical acceleration began. In the subsequent approximately 10 seconds the airplane had a right bank angle of 4° to 6°. At 083903 UTC the right bank angle began to increase. Within one second the bank angle increased to 42° to the right. At the same time the aileron deflection to the left increased to 20° and the vertical acceleration to 1.6 g. In the following second vertical acceleration changed to -3.2 g.At 083904 UTC a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g to the right was recorded. The pitch angle changed from about 3° to about 1°, then within one second increased to 9° and decreased again in the following second to -20°. At the same time the FDR recorded a rudder deflection to the left reaching 11.2° after about two seconds whereas the bank angle changed from 42° right to 31° left.Between 083905 UTC and 083910 UTC Indicated Airspeed (in knots) changed from approximately 277 KIAS to 248 KIAS. The N1 of the left engine of 95% began to decrease.The lateral acceleration then reached 0.94 g left, the autopilot disengaged, and a master warning, lasting seven seconds, was recorded.Both pilots had actuated the aileron to the right in order to stop the rolling motion. But the airplane had continued to roll to the left thereby completing several rotations. Subsequently both Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), the Flight Management System (FMS), and the attitude indication failed.Between 083909 UTC and 083941 UTC the FDR recorded a loss of altitude of approximately 8,700 ft. Large control surface deflections and acceleration were recorded. The speed increased and at 083931 UTC reached approximately 330 KIAS. At 083930 UTC the spoilers extended and 13 seconds later were retracted again. The N1 of the left engine had decreased to approximately 40% when the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) began to increase and nine seconds later had reached 850°. The left engine was shut off.At about 0856 UTC the Pilot in Command (PIC) informed the air traffic controller in Mumbai of the occurrence, declared emergency, and reported their position, altitude and their intention to fly via KITAL to Oman.At about 0915 UTC the crew restarted the left engine. Subsequently the airplane climbed to FL250.

11-JAN-2017,Cessna 560 Citation Encore,LN-IDB,Hesnes Air,0,near Oslo-Garderm...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20170111-0,Initial climb (ICL),Substantial,Icing Loss of control,"The Cessna Citation Encore had flown a passenger from Bern in Switzerland to Oslo-Gardermoen Airport in Norway. The crew had planned a shortest possible ground stop before flying to Torp Sandefjord Airport. The captain flew the aircraft (PF), while the First Officer monitored the flying (PM). During the ground stop at Gardermoen, only one engine was stopped while the First Officer completed an external inspection of the aircraft He did not observe any ice or anything out of the ordinary on the areas of the aircraft that could be inspected.There were icing conditions at Gardermoen and in the airspace above the airport. After flying from Switzerland for more than two hours in approximately minus 50°C, the aircraft's surfaces (fuselage and wings) were more than likely chilled. When the crew requested taxi clearance, they were assigned a different runway than expected. This entailed a longer taxi time and thus longer exposure to the prevailing weather conditions. The aircraft's ground stop lasted approximately 15 minutes at an air temperature of 0°C. The taxiways and runway were covered with 3-6 mm of slush and it was snowing when the aircraft took off.Initially, the take-off proceeded as normal. The landing gear was retracted and both pilots observed that the speed was rapidly approaching 200 kt, which is the maximum speed with flaps deployed.As the flaps were retracted, the crew experienced a violent nose-down movement and the pilots were ""hanging by their seat belts"", while the aircraft started sharply banking to the left. The aircraft at this moment experienced negative 2.62 G.The captain did not trust the instruments while the First Officer had better situational awareness. The First Officer quickly took control and started a pull-out from the dive. The aircraft descended below the cloud base, and even though it was dark, the pilots could glimpse the ground. Control was regained and the aircraft levelled off 170 ft above the ground. The aircraft was overstressed to 5.99 G during the pull-out. The crew called ""MAYDAY"" to the Air Traffic Control. Once control was regained, the ""MAYDAY"" was cancelled and the flight continued towards Torp where an approach and landing took place without further problems.The aircraft was overstressed well above Ultimate Load Factor (-2.16 to +5.40 G) and considered not to be economically viable to repair.Primary conclusion1. The probable explanation for the aircraft suddenly diving, is that the tailplane stalled. AIBN has not found other explanations for this than slush spray from the runway and falling snow and sleet settled on the tailplane's leading edge and underside during taxi and take-off. This contamination is presumed to have frozen to ice.2. The aircraft's anti and de-icing systems on the wings and tailplane were switched on, but the tailplane de-icing system had completed a ""cycle"" before take-off and was in rest mode during take-off. In the assessment by AIBN, the aircraft's anti- and de-icing systems were not suitable to remove the type of ice and snow that had most likely settled on the aircraft's tailplane. The aircraft should have been de-iced before take-off, in line with the company's de-icing procedure, to avoid potential consequences of contamination on the tailplane.3. This accident shows the significance of good crew resource management (CRM) in the cockpit when an unexpected and extreme flight situation occurs. In this instance, the First Officer's situational awareness and initial pull-out contributed to the aircraft not crashing.11-01-2017",Ferry/positioning,AIBN ,2017

16-JAN-2017,Boeing 747-412F,TC-MCL,"ACT Airlines, opf Turkish Cargo",4+ 35,near Bishkek-Mana...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20170116-0,Approach (APR),Destroyed,Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) - Ground,"A Boeing 747-412F cargo plane was destroyed after impacting terrain near Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU). All four crew members and 35 persons on the ground were killed.Flight 6491 departed Hong Kong on a cargo service to Istanbul, carrying a load of 85618 kgs. An en route refueling and crew change stop was planned at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Weather at Bishkek was poor with winds from 60°at 1 m/s and a visibility (RVR) of 400m at the beginning of the runway; 350m at the mid-point and 400m at the end of the runway. Vertical visibility was 50 m. Air temperature was -9°C, dew point -10°C, pressure (QNH) was 1023,9 hPa.The initial descent towards Bishkek was normal. The crew contacted Approach Control at 0706 hours and were cleared for a descent to FL060 as per TOKPA 1 STAR (Standard terminal arrival route). The aircraft overflew the TOPKA reporting point at 0711 at FL092 while in descent. According to the approach chart, FL060 or above should be reached when overflying TOKPA.Shortly afterwards the controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 26. At 0712 the controller cleared the crew for further descent to altitude 3400 ft. The aircraft was meanwhile crossing FL074. The crew was busy monitoring the flight altitude and was aware they were higher than the STAR chart.The localizer was capture at 3600 ft agl. At that time the altitude should have been 1345 ft agl (3400 ft amsl).At 071521 after the crew confirmed capturing the localizer, the flight was handed over to Tower Control.At a distance of 1.7 nm the aircraft reached 3400 ft amsl and the ALT HOLD OPER autopilot mode was engaged longitudinally. At that point the flight was already over 400 ft above the glideslope. The glideslope mode was armed (G/S MODE ARM), but the glideslope was not captured.At 071531 while the aircraft was in level flight at 3400 ft amsl Outer Marker overflight was recorded (as per the approach chart Outer Marker overflight altitude is 2800 ft amsl). A glideslope signal was captured at 071552, at that time the aircraft was almost over VOR/DME MANAS at a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the runway 26 threshold, at an angle of approximately 9°. However, as per the approach chart, the rated glideslope angle is 3°. The aircraft automatically initiated descent with a vertical speed of up to 1425 ft/min.Six seconds after the glideslope capture LAND 3 autoland status annunciation was recorded. The crew called out the annunciation.At 071601 at 3300 ft amsl the aircraft crossed the Middle Marker (as per the approach chart MM overflight altitude is 2290 ft amsl). After the glideslope descent was initiated the glideslope pointer was fluctuating within - 4 to + 4 dots.At 071607, at 3150 ft amsl, AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded. These events were continuously recorded almost until the end of the flight. An FMA FAULT 2 means that the autopilot can no longer track the actual glideslope, but will track a constant 3° glide path until a valid glideslope signal is regained or until the crew intervenes by disengaging the autopilot or initiating a go-around.As the aircraft was descending LAND 3 status degraded to LAND 2, which was confirmed by the crew callout. LAND 2 means that the autopilot flight director system redundancy is reduced to the use of only two of the three autopilots.The EGPWS 'Glideslope' alert was then triggered 5 times. At 071704 the flight crossed the runway 26 departure end at a height of about 110 ft. Decision height was 99 ft. The FO then called ""Minimums"" and the captain informed that there was no visual contact and called to go-around.At 58 ft radar altitude the TOGA switch was pushed and engine power increased. 3.5 seconds after the TOGA switch had been pushed the aircraft hit slightly upsloping terrain and obstacles. The ground speed at the time of impact was 165 kt. The maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 6 g.Initial impact occurred at a distance of approximately 930 m from the runway 26 departure end. It collided with a concrete airport fence and rolled into a holiday village. The aircraft broke up and spilt fuel caught fire.ConclusionThe cause of the Boeing 747-412F TC-MCL aircraft accident was the missing control of the crew over the aircraft position in relation to the glideslope during the automatic approach, conducted at night in the weather conditions, suitable for ICAO CAT II landing, and as a result, the measures to perform a go-around, not taken in due time with the aircraft, having a significant deviation from the established approach chart, which led to the controlled flight impact with terrain (CFIT) at the distance of 930 m beyond the end of the active RWY.The contributing factors were, most probably, the following- the insufficient pre-flight briefing of the flight crew members for the flight to Manas aerodrome (Bishkek), regarding the approach charts, as well as the non-optimal decisions taken by the crew when choosing the aircraft descent parameters, which led to the arrival at the established approach chart reference point at a considerably higher flight altitude;- the lack of the crew's effective measures to decrease the aircraft vertical position and its arrival at the established approach chart reference point while the crew members were aware of the actual aircraft position being higher than required by the established chart;- the lack of the requirements in the Tower controllers' job instructions to monitor for considerable aircraft position deviations from the established charts while the pertinent technical equipment for such monitoring was available;- the excessive psycho-emotional stress of the crew members caused by the complicated approach conditions (night time, CAT II landing, long-lasting working hours) and their failure to eliminate the flight altitude deviations during a long time period. Additionally, the stress level could have been increased due to the crew's (especially the PIC's) highly emotional discussion of the ATC controllers' instructions and actions. Moreover, the ATC controllers' instructions and actions were in compliance with the established operational procedures and charts;- the lack of the crew members' monitoring for crossing the established navigational reference points (the glideslope capture point, the LOM and LIM reporting points);- the crew's failure to conduct the standard operational procedure which calls for altitude verification at the FAF/FAP, which is stated in the FCOM and the airline's OM. On the other hand, the Jeppesen Route Manual, used by the crew, contains no FAF/FAP in the RWY 26 approach chart;- the onboard systems' ""capture"" of the false glideslope beam with the angle of 9°;- the design features of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft type regarding the continuation of the aircraft approach descent in the automatic mode with the constant descent angle of 3° (the inertial path) with the maintained green indication of the armed automatic landing mode (regardless of the actual aircraft position in relation to the RWY) while the aircraft systems detected that the glideslope signal was missing (after the glideslope signal ""capture""). With that, the crew received the designed annunciation, including the aural and visual caution alerts;- the absence of the red warning alert for the flight crew in case of a ""false"" glideslope capture and the transition to the inertial mode trajectory, which would require immediate control actions from the part of the crew;- the lack of monitoring from the part of the crew over the aircraft position in regard to the approach chart, including the monitoring by means of the Navigation Display (ND), engaged in the MAP mode;- the crew's failure to conduct the Airline's Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), regarding the performance of the go-around procedure in case the ""AUTOPILOT"" (the AP switching to the inertial mode) and ""GLIDESLOPE"" (the EGPWS annunciation of the significant glideslope deviation) alerts during the automatic CAT II landing at true heights below 1000 ft (with no visual reference established with either the runway environment or with the lighting system);- the delayed actions for initiating the go-around procedure with no visual reference established with the runway environment at the decision height (DH). In fact, the actions were initiated at the true height of 58 ft with the established minimum of 99 ft.16-01-201716-01-201716-01-201716-01-201716-01-201716-01-201716-01-201716-01-201713 Jan. 2003N5022EBoeing 27 Feb. 20039V-SFLSingapore Airlines Cargo2 Dec. 20119V-SFLSingapore Airlines Cargo5 Dec. 2015TC-MCLMyCargo Airlines1 Jan. 2016TC-MCLMyCargo Airlines11 Jan. 2017TC-MCLMyCargo Airlines",Cargo,MAK ,2017

Upon landing on runway 06, there was a collapse of the left main gear and subsequently a runway excursion occurred. Minor injuries were reported to passengers.The Air Accident Investigation Department has determined that the probable cause of this accident was ineffective crew resource management and an unstable approach which led to the failure of the left main landing gear upon touchdown. Contributing factors to this accident includes; inadequate systems knowledge, lack of situational awareness and failure to diagnose and remedy multiple system failures in a timely manner resulted in compound failures being escalated to an emergency. The apparent rush to get on the ground without exploring other possible options to identify and verify landing gear security also contributed to the severity of this accident.CONTRIBUTING FACTORS- Ineffective CRM, complacency and a complete departure from company standard operating procedures and regulatory requirements were evidently a contributing factor in this accident.- Inadequate training and systems knowledge of both airman greatly contributed to the accident.- Hurried approach to get on the ground and failure to explore all available options to remedy the gear unsafe situation encountered was also a contributory factor.07-02-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAID Bahamas ,2017

The four passengers arrived at the terminal at 0841 and were escorted by the pilot directly to the aircraft. At 0849, the left engine was started and, shortly after, the right engine was started. At 0853, the pilot requested a taxi clearance for King Island, with five persons onboard, under the instrument flight rules. He was cleared to taxi to holding point Tango for runway 17. At 0858, ATC cleared the flight for take-off on runway 17 with departure instructions to turn right onto a heading of 200°. The pilot read back the instruction and commenced the takeoff roll.The aircrafts take-off roll along runway 17 was longer than expected. Witnesses familiar with the aircraft type observed a noticeable yaw to the left after the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft entered a relatively shallow climb and the landing gear remained down. The shallow climb was followed by a substantial left sideslip, while maintaining a roll attitude of less than 10° to the left. Airservices ADS-B data indicated the aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 160 ft above ground level while tracking in an arc to the left of the runway centreline .The aircrafts track began diverging to the left of the runway centreline before rotation and the Following the sustained left sideslip, the aircraft began to descend and at 085848 the pilot transmitted on the Essendon Tower frequency repeating the word 'MAYDAY' seven times in rapid succession. Approximately 10 seconds after the aircraft became airborne, and 2 seconds after the transmission was completed, the aircraft collided with the roof of a building in the Essendon Airport Bulla Road Precinct - Retail Outlet Centre, coming to rest in a loading area at the rear of the building.Contributing factors- The aircraft's rudder trim was likely in the full nose-left position at the commencement of the take-off.- The aircraft's full nose-left rudder trim setting was not detected by the pilot prior to take-off.- Following a longer than expected ground roll, the pilot took-off with full left rudder trim selected. This configuration adversely affected the aircraft's climb performance and controllability, resulting in a collision with terrain.Other factors that increased risk- The flight check system approval process did not identify that the incorrect checklist was nominated in the operators procedures manual and it did not ensure the required checks, related to the use of the cockpit voice recorder, were incorporated.- The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder did not record the accident flight, resulting in a valuable source of safety related information not being available.- The aircraft's maximum take-off weight was likely exceeded by about 240 kilograms.- Two of the four buildings within the Bulla Road Precinct Retail Outlet Centre exceeded the obstacle limitation surface (OLS) for Essendon Airport, however, the OLS for the departure runway was not infringed and VH-ZCR did not collide with those buildings.21-02-201721-02-2017",Private,ATSB ,2017

About 1522 UTC the aircraft entered a holding pattern over the North Sea off the western coast of the Netherlands because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. It left the holding about 1538 UTC and positioned for an ILS approach to runway 22. During the approach to Schiphol, at approximately 1630 hours, ATC requested the crew to hold over reporting point SUGOL at flight level (FL) 110 for 20minutes because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. ATIS information Kilo reported winds from direction 240° with avelocity of 35 knots, gusting to 40 knots. METAR information reported winds at 37 knotsgusting to 46 at 15.55 (UTC, 16.55 local time).From SUGOL the crew initially received radar vectors inbound Schiphol. They then werecleared to intercept the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 22. The ILS for theapproach to runway 22 was intercepted at 18 NM. During the descent, at 1549 UTC, the autopilot disengaged because of gusting winds in the approach and was reengaged by the crew shortly after.The arrival was flown in speed control mode with an airspeed of 170 knots. Final speed was selected at 130 knots, i.e. normal landing threshold speed (VREF) plus 10 knots to compensate for the gusting winds. At around 1551 UTC, approximately 5.5 NM from the runway touchdown point, the landing gear was selected down, giving three greens indication in the cockpit shortly after. The crew confirmed the indication, 15 degrees flaps were selected and de-icing systems were selected.The crew then changed radio frequency to Schiphol Tower and received a clearance for landing on runway 22. The air traffic controller reported the wind from direction 240 degrees with speeds of 36 knots gusting to 48 knots. The crew finished the before landing checklist. They then selected 5 degrees flaps and selected gear down. They confirmed ice protection on, landing gear three greens, selected 15 degrees flaps and checked bleed air on.At an altitude of 300 feet the flight crew disengaged the autopilot for landing. On short final the crew noticed the PAPI showing they were on the glide path. Although the pilots were aware they would encounter strong winds during landing, including crosswinds, the wind conditions were not extreme and were not above the aircrafts limitations. Short final was flown under crosswind conditions, with the nose of the aircraft about 20 degrees right of centre line. Just before touch down the pilot flying aligned the nose of the aircraft with the runway centreline and lowered the right wing to compensate for the crosswind, causing the right-hand main wheel to touch the runway first. The aircraft touched down at 1554 UTC. The crew considered the landing to be firm, but not hard. Almost immediately after touch down the crew noticed the right wing dropping, and a red warning light appeared on the landing gear panel in the cockpit.The right-hand propeller, right-hand engine nacelle, lower fuselage, wing tip and aileron collided with the runway and the aircraft continued for several hundred meters before coming to a complete stop. This resulted in damage to the right hand propeller, the lower fuselage structure and right-hand outboard wing tip. The right-hand fuselage was also damaged due to fragments from the right-hand propeller and stone strikes. The left-hand main landing gear and nose gear remained extended.The crew transmitted a MAYDAY call and after coming to a complete stop the cabin attendants started evacuating the passengers via the two aft doors. The crew then shut down the aircraft in accordance with the checklist. As a precaution, they also pulled the circuit breakers from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. During the accident and following evacuation no-one was injured.Conclusions- Maintenance was performed on the night before the day of the mishap flight, during maintenance the MLG brace was replaced. The maintenance crew stated they did not find anything unusual during the installation of the brace.- After the accident, the newly installed stabilizer brace showed no deformation, nor did the attachment lugs on the yoke or the forward nacelle.- The PSEU showed several fault codes which were consistent with the condition of the aircraft during the approach and after the incident.- One of the MLG down lock sensors was found unreliable. The faulty sensor prevented the PSEU logic from closing the aft RH MLG doors and activating the unlock actuator.- The unlock actuator not being activated prevented the brace being aided to maintain its over centred position by hydraulic pressure.- The RH MLG yoke was found deformed. Analyses, and the fact no deformation was present on the stabilizer brace assembly, indicate that the deformation on the yoke was present prior to touchdown at Schiphol, and that this deformation was caused when NO stabilizer brace assembly was installed.- The deformation of the yoke placed the RH MLG in a condition outside the certification state, thereby exposing the RH MLG stabilizer brace assembly to the potential of unlocking.- The bent yoke caused friction in the MLG yoke and brace combination, which prevented at least one of the two stabilizer brace apex joints from achieving an over centre condition when the MLG was extended prior to landing. Although not designed for this, not hydraulically activating the unlock actuator after the gear was in the down position, prevented the brace assembly from being retained into over centre position.- Despite the fact the gear was not fully locked, and outside certification condition, three green lights indicated to the crew that the gear was down and locked. Although not noticed by the flying crew, the amber caution light indicating the aft RH MLG were open, most likely was lit during landing.- The combination of friction caused by the bent yoke, and faulty sensors preventing the unlock actuator to be activated, caused a situation whereby the stabilizer brace of the RH MLG did not get into over centre position causing an instable situation, despite the three LG green lights illuminated.- During an asymmetric (rolled) touchdown in Amsterdam torsion loads were applied to the MLG, and the MLG strut collapsed almost immediately after touchdown of the RH MLG, causing the accident to happen.23-02-201723-02-201723-02-201723-02-201723-02-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,Dutch Safety Board ,2017
23-FEB-2017,Let L-410UVP-E,OK-LAZ,"Citywing, opb Van Air Europe",0,Isle Of Man-...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20170223-1,Landing (LDG),None,,"A Let L-410, OK-LAZ, was operated by Czech carrier Van Air Europe, on behalf of Citywing, an Isle of Man-based virtual airline that sold seats on flights operated by Van Air.On February 23, 2017, the aircraft was due to operate a return flight from Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM) to Belfast City Airport, Northern Ireland. The scheduled departure time was 0715 UTC and the return flight was scheduled to arrive back at IOM at 0850.Overnight and into the morning of the 23 February, Storm Doris underwent explosive cyclogenesis. The centre of the storm moved rapidly through Northern Ireland in the early hours, across northern England and out into the North Sea by the early afternoon.Strong winds were forecast for the area. The surface wind at Belfast, where runways 04 and 22 were available, was reported at 0620 to be from 230° at 9 kt but, because they received no TAF for this destination, the pilots selected two alternate airports; Belfast International Airport and IOM.The latest weather information at IOM showed a wind from 230° at 32 kt gusting to 45 kt, creating a maximum crosswind component of 22 kt. The relevant maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the Let L-410 is 19.4 kt and this was included in the Performance Limitations section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) but the aircraft operator did not apply a limiting component of crosswind to its operations. The only wind limit that was applied and used by the crew was 45 kt for ground operation.When the wind changed to 260° at 39, gusting to 55 kt, the flight was delayed because this exceeded the ground operation limit,DepartureAt 0750 the crew learnt the wind was from 290° at 31 G 40 kt and as both these more recent reports were within the ground operation limit, they decided to depart, with 550 kg of fuel on board. Three passengers boarded and the aircraft taxied at 0810. Shortly afterwards, at the request of Belfast City ATC, the crew were informed that the wind was from 320° at 31 G 46 kt, and IOM ATC asked the crew for their intentions because Belfast City ATC had reported no other known aircraft movements. The crew elected to continue the flight and took off on runway 26 at 0823 hrs, when the reported wind was from 290° at 21 G 41 kt. The co-pilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF).No difficulties were encountered en route to Belfast.When the PNF contacted Belfast City ATC, he was told radar vectoring was available for an ILS approach to runway 04 and that the wind was now from 320° at 28 G 43 kt. The PNF informed ATC they would make one approach but would go around if the approach was not stable.The crew reported afterwards that they experienced continuous moderate turbulence during the latter part of the approach. The final wind check, given after they had been cleared to land, was from 320° at 35 kt. They judged that the aircraft operators stable approach criteria were met until the aircraft passed over the runway threshold, when turbulence de-stabilised the aircraft and they initiated a go-around.ATC reported that the aircraft went around from approximately 20 ft above the runway at 0858 hrs and climbed straight ahead to 3,000 ft amsl, the standard missed approach procedure. The aircraft continued heading northeast until 0901 hrs when the PNF informed ATC they would not make a second approach and would return to IOM.ReturnOnce level at FL070, the PNF listened to the ATIS for the IOM, which stated runway 26 was in use, it was wet, and detailed the 0850 METAR, which noted that the wind was from 290° at 28 kt. The PF briefed for an approach with the flaps set to 18°, and a target VREF of 105 kt; with a ""slightly right crosswind"". After the brief was completed he commented on the intercom that the wind was ""not so challenging"" at IOM but shortly after this ATC provided a special weather observation, timed at 0912 hrs, which stated the wind was now from 310° at 41 kt and gusting between 22 and 53 kt. When asked by ATC if they wished to make an approach, the PNF replied ""of course"". The crew accepted radar vectoring for an ILS approach to runway 26, with the co-pilot remaining as PF. Before the aircraft was directed towards its final approach, ATC reported the wind was from 310° at 43 kt but gusting between 23 and 63 kt.At 0924, after the aircraft had become established on the ILS centreline and glideslope, ATC radioed clearance to land, with a reported wind of 300° at 41 kt but gusting between 31 and 63 kt. While receiving this message, the crew were also presented with an aural ""glideslope"" caution and immediately after this the PF declared ""1,000 ft stabilised"". While the PNF was adjusting the propeller rpm, another aural ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF immediately stated ""correcting"". Following an automatically generated message stating the aircraft was at 500 ft agl, one further ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF responded saying ""correcting, runway in sight"".The final wind check provided by ATC, approximately 35 seconds before the aircraft touched down, was from 300° at 48 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt. LandingGiven the environmental conditions, ATC was concerned for the safety of the aircraft and its occupants when it landed, so the airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) had been placed on alert with two vehicles facing towards the runway, approximately 200 m from the touchdown zone. During the aircrafts approach, ATC discussed the situation with the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration because another of the same operators aircraft had been blown onto its wingtip while taxiing in 2007, in winds greater than 45 kt, and both parties knew 45 kt was now the operators maximum ground operation limit.As the aircraft crossed the threshold it seemed unstable and it rolled considerably, causing the tip of the left wing (the downwind wing) to tilt down until it seemed in close proximity to the runway, before the wheels made first contact. The aircraft then bounced and rolled left again before touching down for a second time, on all three wheels.After travelling along the runway for approximately 20 m, the right mainwheel was seen to lift off the ground and nearby RFFS witnesses estimated the left wingtip rolled to within one metre of the runway surface. The crew seemed aware of this roll because, approximately nine seconds after touchdown, the PF stated ""ailerons...good...too much roll"". After landing the commander took control and the co-pilot commented ""taxi carefully with the wind"". ATC then stated the surface wind was from 300° at 47 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt and asked if they wished to taxi or to hold on the runway. The crew replied ""we will try and taxi and if we can make it we will vacate, otherwise we need to leave the aircraft here"". The crew then accepted taxi instructions directing them towards the terminal but, 45 seconds later, as the aircraft was leaving the runway, ATC radioed to the crew, ""direction from Isle of Man CAA, hold position."" The aircraft stopped facing into the wind. Both ATC and the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration later indicated that they were concerned that if the aircraft continued to taxi with the wind gusting to 63 kt an accident could occur. RFFS vehicles were positioned around the aircraft, to provide some screening from the wind, and a bus transferred the three uninjured passengers to the terminal building. The aircraft was later tied down until the wind subsided.ConclusionThe prime causal factor in this serious incident was the decision to land with a maximum crosswind component of 40 kt, which is approximately twice the maximum demonstrated certification value of 19.4 kt. In the view of the aircraft operator, there was no specific crosswind limit the crew needed to consider when deciding whether to operate the service or not. However, the OM Part A refers to a crosswind limit when it statesFor planning purposes an aerodrome shall be considered below minimum if the steady crosswind exceeds the prescribed limitations.and other evidence from the AFM and the OM indicates that the maximum demonstrated crosswind component of 19.4 kt was limiting.Several contributory factors were also apparent1) By only studying weather reports for six airfields and without referring to any meteorology charts, the crew had insufficient information to assess the prevailing weather conditions en route and the storms path.2) The aircraft operator believed that a valid TAF could be disregarded upon the subsequent issue of a METAR that included a TREND forecast.3) The aircraft operator did not provide adequate oversight to a flight in airspace affected by this storm. The commander did not refer to the available weather forecast charts and neither the OCC nor the FOM reviewed the situation with him, or suggested he seek guidance from the duty forecaster.4) The fuel figures presented on the OFP did not account for the correct level of contingency fuel and did not allow for a realistic alternate routing. The aircraft had sufficient fuel for the sector, but the crew did not have as much extra fuel on-board as they believed they had, and the OM offered little guidance on the carriage of extra fuel when there was a possibility of widespread, adverse weather conditions.5) The OFP only showed navigational and fuel information for the second of two selected alternates. However, the two Belfast airports are in close proximity so the lack of navigational information for the routing to the first alternate may not have been problematic in this instance.6) The CVR evidence, that evolving threats did not precipitate verbal discussion between the pilots, indicates they had not been effectively trained in respect to CRM, and to threat management in particular. The OM appeared to lack guidance concerning the evaluation and management of threats, problem solving and decision making.7) The approach became unstable before visual flight conditions were achieved, but the crew did not discuss this, and the required SOPs were not followed.8) The limiting airspeed for flight with gear down and for flight with flaps extended was exceeded but no corrective action was taken.9) The crew began taxiing the aircraft in a wind which was stronger than the wind which blew a similar aircraft onto its wingtip at IOM in 2007 and which exceeded the ground operation limit introduced after the 2007 accident.23-02-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2017

During the pushback from Stand 1 at Manchester Airport, in dark and wet conditions, the flight deck crew felt a fore and aft jolt and heard a mechanical ""clunk"". The commander informed the headset operator who conferred with the tug driver, and then visually checked the towbar and its attachment to the tug and to the aircraft. The ground crew saw nothing abnormal and they assumed the clunk was due to the tow hitch shifting, which is a familiar occurrence. The headset operator informed the commander that all was well, and the pushback continued. In response to a request from the commander, the headset operatorindicated the left engine could be started, although the aircraft had not reached the designated engine start positon for that stand.As the aircraft was halted, in preparation for being pulled forward to the release point, the headset operator approved a request from the flight deck crew to start the right engine.The commander was conscious of the aircraft beginning to move gently forward, while he was concentrating on starting the right engine. Both the tug and the headset operator were concealed from his field of view and he was not surprised when the aircrafts nose turned first to the right and then to the left, as if it was being lined-up on the taxiway centreline. He then heard an urgent instruction from the headset operator for the brakes to be applied, so he responded by pressing on the toe brakes before setting the park brake. The headset operator then informed him that the tug and aircraft had collided, but that nobody was injured. Both engines were then shut down.Ground crew from adjacent stands came to assist and found the towbar was still connected to both the tug and to the aircraft. The nose gear leg was rotated approximately 90° to the left and the tow bar was bent around the front corner of the tug. The shear pins on the towbar had fractured, and pieces were later found within the boundary of the stand, but the central retaining pin remained intact. The passengers and crew disembarked without injury from the rear right exit door.An investigation by the ground handling company showed One of the pins on this towbar had failed 16 days before the accident and only that pin had been replaced. It was also established that other maintenance procedures for the shear pins had not been followed. They had not been lubricated correctly and the training given to ground crews did not prepare them for conducting adequate serviceability checks on the pins.No Probable Cause was issued by the AAIB",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2017
08-MAR-2017,MD-83,N786TW,Ameristar Jet Charter,0,Detroit-Will...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20170308-0,Takeoff (TOF),Substantial,Elevator issue  Rejected takeoff Runway excursion,"A McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N786TW, suffered a runway excursion following an aborted takeoff from runway 23L at Detroit-Willow Run Airport, Michigan, USA. The aircraft had been chartered by the University of Michigan Basketball team for a flight to a game in Washington, DC.The flight crew prepared for take-off and calculated V-speeds (V1, VR, V2) using ""Normal Thrust Takeoff"", a 10 kts headwind, and a take-off weight of 146,600 lbs. The V-speeds for this configuration were 139 kts, 142 kts, and 150 kts, respectively. However, the flight crew chose to increase VR to 150 kts to allow for more control during take-off in the presence of windshear.During takeoff roll, at 145156 (about 3,000 ft down the runway) and about 138 kts of airspeed, the control column was pulled back slightly from a non-dimensional value of -7 to -5.52. The airplanes left elevator followed the control input and moved from a position of -15° trailing edge down to -13° trailing edge down. The right elevator did not change and stayed at approximately -16° trailing edge down. At 145201 a large control column input was made (151 kts and 4100 ft down the runway) to a non-dimensional 18.5 and the left elevator moves to a position near 15° trailing edge up. After 145205 the right elevator moves to -13° trailing edge down, but no more. The airplane does not respond in pitch and does not rotate. The captain decided to abort the takeoff.The maximum groundspeed was 163 kts (173 kts airspeed) and the airplane began to decelerate as soon as the brakes were applied at 145208. Spoilers were deployed at 145210 and thrust reversers were deployed between 145213 and 145215. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway. The airplanes ground speed was 100 kts when it left the paved surface.The aircraft overran the end of the runway, damaged approach lights, went through the perimeter fence and crossed Tyler Road.It came to rest on grassy terrain, 345 meters past the end of the runway, with the rear fuselage across a ditch. The nose landing gear had collapsed. Runway 23L is a 7543 ft long runway.Post-accident examination by the NTSB revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand.Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots.Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.  The airplane flew to Ypsilanti two days before the accident.Probable Cause ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the jammed condition of the airplanes right elevator, which resulted from exposure to localized, dynamic wind while the airplane was parked and rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff. Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplanes parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD-83 airplane. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was the captains timely and appropriate decision to reject the takeoff,the check airmans disciplined adherence to standard operating procedures after the captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the dimensionally compliant runway safety area where the overrun occurred.""08-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-201708-03-2017",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2017

The aircraft came to rest on the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed and the right hand wing tip was bent.Kalaupapa Airport is an uncontrolled (nontowered) airport with a single runway and no taxiways. The pilots use a common frequency to state their intentions. The pilot of the Grand Caravan reported that she was going to establish an approach and landing to runway 05. While on a seven-mile final, she communicated with the pilot of an airplane that was on short final for the same airport. The pilot that was on short final reported that he would report when he was clear of the runway, and he did. The commuter pilot acknowledged the other pilot's clear of runway transmission, and initiated the approach. As the pilot descended through 150 feet above ground level, she noticed that the airplane that she had communicated with was not clear of the runway. The airplane on the ground was near the runway 23 numbers with the propeller turning, facing toward her landing airplane. She aborted the landing but the airplane did not climb. The airplane impacted the runway hard and bounced. She reported that when the airplane touched down after the bounce, she ""applied left rudder pedal to steer the aircraft off the runway and out of the way of the other aircraft's possible flight path.""

The private pilot, and soleoccupant, was fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and post-impact fire.The flight originated from Cincinnati Airport, Ohio, about 1812 hours local time, and was destined for Atlanta-Fulton County Airport, Georgia. The flight was uneventful until the air traffic controller amended the flight plan, which required the pilot to manually enter the new routing information into the GPS. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was having problems with the GPS and asked for a direct route to his destination. The controller authorized the direct route and instructed the pilot to descend from 22,000 ft to 6,000 ft, during which time the sound of the autopilot disconnect was heard on the cockpit voice recorder.During the descent, the pilot told the controller that the airplane had a steering problem and was in the clouds. The pilot was instructed to descend the airplane to 4,100 ft, which was the minimum vectoring altitude. The airplane continued to descend, entered visual meteorological conditions, and then descended below the assigned altitude. The controller queried the pilot about the airplane's low altitude and instructed the pilot to maintain 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that he was unsure if he would be able to climb the airplane back to that altitude due to steering issues. The controller issued a low altitude warning and again advised the pilot to climb back to 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that the autopilot was working again and that he was able to climb the airplane to the assigned altitude.The controller then instructed the pilot to change to another radio frequency, but the pilot responded that he was still having a problem with the GPS. The pilot asked the controller to give him direct routing to the airport. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was barely able to keep the airplane straight and its wings level. The controller asked the pilot if he had the airport in sight, which he did not. The pilot then declared an emergency and expressed concerns related to identifying the landing runway. Afterward, radio contact between the controller and the pilot was lost. Shortly before the airplane impacted the ground, a witness saw the airplane make a complete 360° roll to the left, enter a steep 90° bank to the left, roll inverted, and enter a vertical nose-down dive. Another witness saw the airplane spiral to the ground. The airplane impacted the front lawn of a private residence, and a postcrash fire ensued. The aircraft was a Sierra Eagle wing conversion of a Cessna 500 Citation I. This performance upgrade also allows single pilot operations. However, the NTSB found no record of the pilot receiving training for single-pilot operations in the accident airplane. Therefore it was unlikely that the pilot was properly certificated to act as a single-pilot.The pilot historically had difficulty flying the airplane without the aid of the autopilot. Given the pilot's previous experience with the GPS installed on the airplane, it is likely that during the accident flight the pilot became confused about how to operate the GPS and ultimately was unable to properly control of the airplane without the autopilot engaged.Probable causeThe pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while manually flying the airplane, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inability control the airplane without the aid of the autopilot.24-03-201724-03-2017",Executive,NTSB ,2017

All occupants evacuated. Malaysia Airlines confirmed there were no injuries.The flight departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia at 2008 hours LT. Rainshowers were passing the destination of Sibu Airport as the aircraft attempted to land on runway 13.The aircraft veered to the right of Runway 13 and travelled approximately 480 m on the soft ground parallel to the runway before coming to a stop diagonally towards the runway edge. The nose gear collapsed just before the aircraft came to a complete stop.All passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aircraft using the two forward slides. No injuries were reported during the whole serious incident. The aircraft sustained damages to the nose gear assembly and also the lower fuselage aft of the nose gear, while areas around the flaps, engine cowling and fan bypass areas sustained minor damages as a result of the runway excursion.CAUSAL FACTORS1 A sudden increase in the intensity of rain while approaching the runway at night resulted in the significant reduction of the PF's visual reference. Under these conditions and without the runway centerline lights, the PF did not detect the lateral movement of the aircraft in time to correct the displacement from the runway centerline.2 Pilot induced oscillation resulting in the progressive input of roll angle to the right of up to 6 degrees during flare maneuver without any considerable left rudder input. This resulted in a drift in the aircraft heading towards the right side of the runway. The resultant drift angle recorded on touchdown was 4 degrees (Runway heading is 129° while the touch down heading was 133°).3 The PF had likely lost his positional awareness with reference to the runway edge due to the degraded visibility, hence, did not exert sufficient and timely rudder application to regain the runway centerline before departing the surface of the runway.CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS1 Continuous rain with changing intensity over the airfield throughout the approach and landing.2 Inadequate risk assessment on the prevailing weather conditions made by the flight crew through the established TEM briefing as stipulated in the MAB OM (A).3 The elevated pitch attitude after touchdown may have caused the reduction of visual reference to the runway. This would reduce the effectiveness of braking and cornering ability of the aircraft due to reduced weight on the main landing gear. 4 Lack of assertiveness by the PM in getting the attention of the PF to the developing and impending deviation from centerline. Currently, there is no standard callout stipulated in the MAB OM (A) with reference to the calling out of centerline deviation.5 Absence of centerline lights at night in the reduced visibility conditions due to the heavy rain made it difficult for the PF to acquire the required visual reference to conduct a safe landing and roll out.6 The Black hole effect is prevalent during night approaches into Sibu due to the lack of lightings and visual reference surrounding the airport. This could result in an optical illusion leading towards a false pitch or bank perception, especially during approaches with reduced visibility such as in heavy rain or fog.7 Rubber deposit on the runway could have caused the runway centerline markings to become less discernable, especially when the runway surface was wet and in reduced visibility condition.8 Inadequate updates of weather reports that were provided by the ATC controller to the pilots as and when considerable changes to the weather conditions over the airfield were observed.9 Use of single RVR readout as means of reporting the visibility in heavy rain or thunderstorm at night did not alert the pilots on the severity of precipitation at the airport. The transmissiometer only measures the horizontal visibility at a specific range around the unit located near runway thresholds.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB Malaysia ,2017

The crew consisted of the line supervising captain, the copilot and a line training captain, sitting in the observation seat, to evaluate the copilot for his completion of line training.The copilot was the aircraft's pilot flying (PF) during the whole route. The flight went smoothly and the crew carried out the final ILS Z approach manoeuvre for runway 10 at the Alicante-Elche Airport maintaining stabilized approach parameters as described in the operator's manual. Nine seconds after starting the landing flare manoeuvre, touchdown was made with a pitch attitude of 5°, a calibrated speed of 119 kt and a vertical descent speed of 240 fpm. There was a vertical acceleration of 1.45 G corresponding to a firm impact. The flare manoeuvre was considered slow, which the manufacturer identifies as a risk factor for tail strike.The position of the control column was slackened slightly after touchdown was made, but the pitch attitude tendency continued to increase until it reached a value of 10.2°, reaching a 1.14 G vertical acceleration value. This attitude was maintained for one second, causing the rear of the aircraft to strike the runway surface.After the tail area had struck the runway, the captain took control of the aircraft and continued the landing manoeuvre, completing it without any additional problems.The flight crew were unaware that the aircraft's tail area had touched the runway until they were informed at the parking area by one of the cabin crew that they had heard an unusual noise when landing. The aircraft suffered damage to the lower part of the tail cone. All the people on board disembarked normally without any medical attention being required.Causes / Contributing factorsThe investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was incorrect pitch position control during landing.As a contributing factor, the fact that the aircraft captain (PM) could have intervened before the accident to correct the situation is highlighted.10-04-2017",International Scheduled Passenger,CIAIAC ,2017

A few seconds after taking off from runway 33, the landing gear lever was selected to the Up position. About 20 seconds later, the crew discovered that the landing gear had not retracted. The landing gear remained in the Down & Locked position because the landing gear safety pins were set. The crew suspected that the safety pins were still set and decided to land back at Salzburg Airport, which was carried out on runway 15. After a flight time of about 5 minutes, the aircraft left the runway at about 1017 on taxiway E. They were instructed by the control tower to taxi back to the parking area (apron). The aircraft was stopped shortly after taxiing on taxiway E, as the crew noticed an increased rolling resistance of the aircraft, whereby the crew suspected a burst tyre. The crew decided to check directly at the taxiway whether the safety pins were still on the landing gear, to remove them if necessary and to check whether a tire was defective. The control tower of Salzburg Airport was not informed about this by the pilots. The co-pilot opened the cabin door and left the aircraft to perform these checks. Meanwhile, the pilot left the cockpit to inform the passengers in the cabin of the situation.At 1020 and 1022, the Salzburg Tower controller tried without success to make contact with the aircraft's crew. An aircraft passing taxiway L informed the controller about a person on the taxiway who had left the aircraft in question.The co-pilot, who had gone to the landing gear, recognized that the safety pins were installed and tried to remove them. When this attempt failed because hydraulic pressure was applied to the landing gear cylinder and the safety pin was jammed, he operated the landing gear door control valves of the nose and main landing gear several times and installed the landing gear doors control valve pins. This closed the landing gear doors, the main cylinders of the hydraulics of the main and nose landing gear were depressurized and the safety pins could be removed. After the co-pilot removed the nose landing gear door pin, the nose landing gear doors opened and the nose landing gear folded at about 1030. The aircraft nose lowered and hit the taxiway. 5 to 10 seconds later the engines were switched off.No indication could be found that both the Landing Gear Failure to Retract and the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed Checklist were executed from the time the installed Safety Pins were detected until the time of the accident.11-04-2017",Executive,UUS Austria ,2017

On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 lbs of fuel.At 1144 hours local time, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Tanahmerah and cruised at altitude of 7,000 feet. Estimate time arrival at Oksibil would be 1224.At 1212, when the aircraft position was about 45 NM north of Tanahmerah, the aircraft passed another Cessna 208B aircraft from the opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanahmerah. The Cessna 208B pilot advised to the pilot via radio that the PK-FSO aircraft was in sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to Oksibil.The pilot failed to contact the Oksibil air traffic controller and failed to arrive at the destination. The airline's flight following officer received an emergency signal with a last recorded position of 6 NM north of Oksibil. The next day the aircraft was found on a ridge of Anem Mountain at a height of 7100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was fatally injured.The investigation learned that two days prior the occurrence, the pilot travelled on a night commercial flight. This might have resulted in a sleep disturbance during the window of circadian low and an increase of the potential of fatigue. There are indications that the pilot did not have the required adequate restorative sleep before he started flying on the accident day. Prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot had flown for 3 flight sectors, with total flight hour of 2 hours 55 minutes. The multiple take-offs and landings that day increased fatigue. Based on the final flight track, the absence of voice communication, the weather condition permitting the pilot to identify the airport location and the aircraft wreckage, consistently indicated that there were no pilot activities to fly the aircraft after the last known pilot activities at about 29 Nm from Oksibil until impact.Colleagues of the pilot reported that he often smoked in the cockpit during the flight, looked sleepy and engaged the Terrain Inhibit switch which disabled the GA-EGPWS function while flying. This prevented any prior warning when the aircraft neared Anem Mountain.This known behavior was not reported to the Operation and Safety department, so no action could be taken.Contributing Factors ""The possibility of the pilot being fatigue, physical and environment condition increased pilot sleepiness which might have made the pilot inadvertently falling asleep indicated by no pilot activity.

The occurrence aircraft performed the final approach in left crosswind and landed with its nose yawing to the left. It was probably  affected by the clockwise horizontal wind shear on the runway and pilot's operation, the aircraft began drifting to the left after touching down.2. As the aircraft was drifting to the left, the Captain had used right rudder to correct the deviation, and also pulled the power levers into the reverse range. According to the recorded engine data of torque and (reverse) power of both engines, it revealed that the Captain inadvertently pulled back the left power lever while he was intending to apply the right-turning differential power to assist him in correcting the left drift. It resulted in increasing the left reverse power and intensified the aircrafts left drifting tendency.3. Though the Captain attempted to get the directional control of aircraft by increasing the right rudder input and the right wheel brake pressure, however he still kept increasing the reverse power of left engine to the maximum, not knowing that he was taking the wrong side.

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft originated from Louisville International Airport, Kentucky at 0541 hours. As the flight neared Yeager Airport at an altitude of 9000 ft, the crew received the most recent ATIS report for the airport indicating wind from 080° at 11 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 700 ft agl, and a broken ceiling at 1300 ft agl.However, a special weather observation recorded about 7 minutes before the flight crew's initial contact with the approach controller indicated that the wind conditions had changed to 170° at 4 knots and that cloud ceilings had dropped to 500 ft agl. The approach controller did not provide the updated weather information to the flight crew and did not update the ATIS.The approach controller advised the flight crew to expect the localizer 5 approach, which would have provided a straight-in final approach course aligned with runway 5. The first officer acknowledged the instruction but requested the VOR-A circling instrument approach, presumably because the approach procedure happened to line up with the flight crew's inbound flightpath and flying the localizer 5 approach would result in a slightly longer flight to the airport. However, because the localizer 5 approach was available, the flight crew's decision to fly the VOR-A circling approach was contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP).The minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the localizer approach was 373 ft agl, and the MDA for the VOR-A approach was about 773 ft agl. With the special weather observation indicating cloud cover at 500 ft agl, it would be difficult for the pilots to see the airport while at the MDA for the VOR-A approach; yet, the flight crew did not have that information. The approach controller was required to provide the flight crew with the special weather report indicating that the ceiling at the arrival airport had dropped below the MDA, which could have prompted the pilots to use the localizer approach; however, the pilots would not have been required to because the minimum visibility for the VOR-A approach was within acceptable limits.The approach controller approved the first officer's request then cleared the flight direct to the first waypoint of the VOR-A approach and to descend to 4000 ft. Radar data indicated that as the flight progressed along the VOR-A approach course, the airplane descended 120 feet below the prescribed minimum stepdown altitude of 1720 ft two miles prior to FOGAG waypoint. The airplane remained level at or about 1600 ft until about 0.5 mile from the displaced threshold of the landing runway. At this point, the airplane entered a 2500 ft-per-minute, turning descent toward the runway in a steep left bank up to 42° in an apparent attempt to line up with the runway.Performance analysis indicates that, just before the airplane impacted the runway, the descent rate decreased to about 600 fpm and pitch began to move in a nose-up direction, suggesting that the captain was pulling up as the airplane neared the pavement; however, it was too late to save the approach. At 0650, the airplane impacted the runway 5 centerline in a 22° left bank and 5° nose-down at an airspeed of about 92 knots. The airplane's left wingtip struck the pavement first, followed by the left main landing gear and left propeller. The fuselage impacted the pavement and the left wing separated from the airplane during the impact sequence. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway through the grass safety area and down a hill through trees, coming to rest about 380 feet left of the runway centerline and 85 ft below the runway elevation.Video and witness information were not conclusive as to whether the captain descended below the MDA before exiting the cloud cover; however, the descent from the MDA was not in accordance with federal regulations, which required, in part, that pilots not leave the MDA until the ""aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal descent rate using normal maneuvers."" The accident airplane's descent rate was not in accordance with company guidance, which stated that ""a constant rate of descent of about 500 ft./min. should be maintained."" Rather than continue the VOR-A approach with an excessive descent rate and airplane maneuvering, the captain should have conducted a missed approach and executed the localizer 5 approach procedure.No evidence was found to indicate why the captain chose to continue the approach; however, the captain's recent performance history, including an unsatisfactory checkride due to poor instrument flying, indicated that his instrument flight skills were marginal. It is possible that the captain felt more confident in his ability to perform an unstable approach to the runway compared to conducting the circling approach to land.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The flight crew's improper decision to conduct a circling approach contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP) and the captain's excessive descent rate and maneuvering during the approach, which led to inadvertent, uncontrolled contact with the ground. Contributing to the accident was the operator's lack of a formal safety and oversight program to assess hazards and compliance with SOPs and to monitor pilots with previous performance issues.""05-05-201705-05-201705-05-201705-05-201705-05-201705-05-201705-05-201705-05-201705-05-201731 May 1979G-BGNAShorts27 Sep 1979G-BGNALoganair29 April 1983G-BGNAManx Airlines1 Nov. 1983G-BGNAAir Ecosse19 April 1984G-BGNAMetropolitan Airways24 Oct 1985G-BGNAShorts21 Nov 1985G-BTJRShorts24 Sep. 1986SE-IVXSyd-Aero1 July 1988SE-IVXAvia12 Sep. 1989G-BTJRShorts19 Dec. 1989VH-LSIQueensland Pacific Airlines25 Oct. 1990VH-LSISunstate Airlines19 Feb. 1996VH-LSIAirnorth Central20 April 1998N334ACCorporate Air14 Dec. 1998N334ACAir Cargo Carriers16 April 2004N334ACAir Cargo Carriers",Cargo,NTSB ,2017

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries.The flight departed from the Philadelphia International Airport, Pennsylvania, about 1504 on a repositioning flight destined for Teterboro (TEB).The crew filed a flight plan for the accident flight that included altitude (27,000 ft) and time en route (28 minutes) entries that were incompatible with each other, which suggests that the crew devoted little attention to preflight planning. The crew also had limited time in flight to plan and brief the approach, as required by company policy, and did not conduct an approach briefing before attempting to land at TEB.Cockpit voice recorder data indicated that the  second-in-command (SIC) was the pilot flying (PF) from PHL to TEB, despite a company policy prohibiting the SIC from acting as PF based on his level of experience. Although the accident flight was likely not the first time that the SIC acted as PF, based on comments made during the flight. The PIC regularly coached the SIC from before takeoff to the final seconds of the flight. The extensive coaching likely distracted the PIC from his duties as PIC and pilot monitoring, such as executing checklists and entering approach waypoints into the flight management system.Collectively, procedural deviations and errors resulted in the flight crews lack of situational awareness throughout the flight and approach to TEB. Because neither pilot realized that the airplanes navigation equipment had not been properly set for the instrument approach clearance that the flight crew received, the crew improperly executed the vertical profile of the approach, crossing an intermediate fix and the final approach fix hundreds of feet above the altitudes specified by the approach procedure.The controller had vectored the flight for the instrument landing system runway 6 approach, circle to runway 1. When the crew initiated the circle-to-land maneuver, the airplane was 2.8 nautical miles (nm) beyond the final approach fix (about 1 mile from the runway 6 threshold) and could not be maneuvered to line up with the landing runway, which should have prompted the crew to execute a go-around because the flight did not meet the companys stabilized approach criteria. However, neither pilot called for a go-around. The PIC, who had assumed control of the airplane at this point in the flight, continued the approach by initiating a turn to align with the landing runway. Radar data indicated that the airplanes airspeed was below the approach speed required by company standard operating procedures (SOP). During the turn, the airplane stalled and impacted the ground in a right wing low and nose down attitude in an industrial area between Kero Road and Commerce Road in Carlstadt, New Jersey, 1000 m short of runway 01. A fire erupted and consumed the aircraft. Both crew members died in the accident.Probable Cause ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the PICs attempt to salvage an unstabilized visual approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the PICs decision to allow an unapproved SIC to act as PF, the PICs inadequate and incomplete preflight planning, and the flight crews lack of an approach briefing. Also contributing to the accident were Trans-Pacifics lack of safety programs that would have enabled the company to identify and correct patterns of poor performance and procedural noncompliance and the FAAs ineffective SAS procedures, which failed to identify these company oversight deficiencies.""15-05-201715-05-201715-05-2017",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2017

The aircraft operated on a cargo charter flight with 1680 kg cargo on board. It took off from Kathmandu at 0744 UTC at flight 409, bound for Lukla.It was the 5th flight of the aircraft to Lukla and with the same set of crew. Lukla weather was cloudy, but visibility and ceiling was reported to be fine after an hour of heavy rain. On first contact flight 409 reported abeam Rumjatar descending out of 11300 ft at 0810 UTC. Lukla Tower provided the latest weather at the airport, as well as enroute weather relayed by 9N-AGU, an AS350 helicopter that had departed Lukla for Kathmandu. Almost 4 minutes after the first contact, Tower informed flight 409 about the deteriorating weather. The right base leg was covered by lifting fog though there was no rain and the final approach area was still visible.Weather deteriorated further and Tower regularly updated the flight crew. About 30 seconds after flight 409 reported entering valley, Lukla Tower again informed about the latest status of the further deteriorating weather. Flight 409 then informed that they would come up to Bhatkeko Daada and then decide. The pilot also informed they could see some bright spots.While continuing approach, both cockpit crew sighted the runway at 9100 ft. That was 64 seconds before the impact. While continuing approach the aircraft deviated to the right by almost 15 degrees and erroneously descended too low to 8500 ft whereas threshold height is 8900 ft (on Kathmandu QNH, whereas per AIP it is 9200 ft). The flight crew attempted to climb and reach the threshold in a landing configuration. The aircraft pitched up to over 25°, the airspeed dropped and the aircraft stalled. Subsequently its left wing first hit a small tree and then impacted the sloping terrain 130 feet short of the runway.The captain and copilot both sustained fatal injuries.Probable Cause The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was aircraft stall as a result of excessive drag created by sudden increase in angle of attack of the aircraft supplemented by low speed (below Vref) in an attempt to initiate immediate climb on a landing configuration (full flap and landing gear down) warranted by the critical situation of the final phase of flight.The contributing factors for the accident area. Critical terrain and rapidly deteriorating weather condition.b. Pilot's loss of situational awarenessc. Improper pilot response to stall warning including failure to advance power lever to maximum at appropriate time.d. Voilation of SOP by the ATS and Pilot as well.27-05-2017",Cargo,AAIC Nepal ,2017

At 235552, the airplane flew too far right of course to be observed by the local controllers ASDE-X/ASSC and was not visible on the ASDE-X/ASSC display for about 12 seconds. Four seconds later, when AC759 was about 0.3 mile from the landing threshold, the local controller confirmed and recleared AC759 to land on runway 28R. The flight crew of the first airplane in queue on taxiway C (UA1) transmitted statements regarding AC759, one of which mentioned the alignment of AC759 with the taxiway while AC759 was on short final. The flight crew of the second airplane in queue on taxiway C switched on their airplanes landing lights as the incident airplane approached. The incident pilots advanced the thrust levers when the airplane was about 85 ft agl. FDR data indicate that the airplane was over the taxiway at this time, approaching the vicinity of taxiway W. At 235604, AC759 reappeared on the local controllers ASDE-X/ASSC display as it passed over the first airplane positioned on taxiway C. About 2.5 seconds after advancing the thrust levers, the minimum altitude recorded on the FDR was 59 ft agl. At 235610, the local controller directed AC759 to go around. The airplane had already begun to climb at this point. At the time of the incident, runway 28L was closed to accommodate construction; its approach and runway lights were turned off, and a 20.5-ft-wide lighted flashing X (runway closure marker) was placed at the threshold.

UA1118 SFO-MCO, Boeing 737-924ER N62895Probable Cause The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this incident was the flight crews misidentification of taxiway C as the intended landing runway, which resulted from the crewmembers lack of awareness of the parallel runway closure due to their ineffective review of NOTAM information before the flight and during the approach briefing. Contributing to the incident were (1) the flight crews failure to tune the ILS frequency for backup lateral guidance, expectation bias, fatigue due to circadian disruption and length of continued wakefulness, and breakdowns in CRM and (2) Air Canadas ineffective presentation of approach procedure and NOTAM information.",International Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2017
10-JUL-2017,Lockheed KC-130T Hercules,165000,USMC,16,"near Itta Bena, MS",https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20170710-0,En route (ENR),Destroyed,Airframe failure Loss of control,"A United States Marine Corps (USMC) Reserve Lockheed KC-130T Hercules broke up and crashed in the vicinity of Itta Bena, Mississippi, USA. All 16 on board were killed. The aircraft originated from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C., 1t 1407 hours to transport personnel and equipment to Naval Air Field El Centro, California.While the aircraft was flying at 20,000 feet, the number four blade from the number two propeller departed and sliced through the left side of the fuselage, and impacted the interior of the right side, initiating the catastrophic sequence of events. This impact caused the skin of the aircraft to separate along the starboard side. The energy transferred from the propeller blade's impact through the structure of the airframe also caused an overload condition of propeller three's drive shaft. This resulted in its associated reduction gearbox assembly (RGA) failing and the separation of propeller three from the aircraft. Propeller three then momentarily embedded into the upper right section of the fuselage. After which it continued over the aft starboard section of the fuselage and impacted the starboard horizontal stabilizer separating a significant portion of the stabilizer from the aircraft.The aircraft structure forward of the wings then began to separate, resulting in the cockpit section separating and creating a trail of debris. The absence of the cockpit resulted in the forward section of the central fuselage creating a violent nonaerodynamic drag moment, which exceeded engineering tolerances and greatly accelerated fuselage break up forward of the wing box structure. The fuselage section from the wing box structure aft, continued to fly in a general southwest direction with enough dynamic stability that allowed the fuselage to reenter a downward attitude until final impact in a soybean field.The investigation determined the cause of the mishap to be an inflight departure of the number four blade from the number two propeller. This propeller blade (P2B4) liberated while the aircraft was flying at a cruise altitude of 20,000 feet . The liberation of P2B4 initiated the catastrophic sequence of events resulting in the midair breakup of the aircraft and its uncontrollable descent and ultimate destruction.Post-mishap analysis of P2B4 revealed that a circumferential fatigue crack in the blade caused the fracture and liberation. This fatigue crack propagated from a radial crack which originated from intergranular cracking (IGC) and corrosion pitting. The analysis also revealed the presence of anodize coating within the band of corrosion pitting and intergranular cracking on the blade near the origin of the crack. This finding proves that the band of corrosion pitting and intergranular cracking was present and not removed during the last overhaul of P2B4 at Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC) in the fall of 2011. The investigation concluded that the failure to remediate the corrosion pitting and intergranular cracking was due to deficiencies in the propeller blade overhaul process at WR-ALC which existed in 2011 and continued up until the shutdown of the WR-ALC propeller blade overhaul process in the fall of 2017.The investigation also examined whether any operational or intermediate level maintenance inspections or maintenance actions exist which could have detected the underlying causal conditions prior to the mishap. The investigation concluded that while these inspections exist, it cannot be quantifiably determined that these inspections would have detected the causal condition. Theinvestigation arrived at this conclusion due to the fact that the growth or propagation rate of an IGC radial crack cannot be predicted. Though no evidence exists to determine when the radial crack had grown to a detectable area, beyond the bushing, there exists a distinct possibility that it could have been detected if the radial crack had grown past the bushing and the off wing eddy current inspection was performed.10-07-2017",Military, ,2017

The following morning the aircraft was prepared for a repositioning flight to Accra, Ghana.Sao Tome Tower initially cleared Cavok Air flight 7087 to taxi on runway 11 as favoured by the prevailing wind. However, the crew requested runway 29 for departure. This request was approved by the controller and the aircraft was re-cleared to taxi to runway 29 for departure. Sao Tome Tower did not provide the flight crew with the information about possible presence of birds at the airport, in particular, on the runway.At 0905, the aircraft began the take-off roll. The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). The engines and systems parameters were reported to be normal.In the first half of the take-off run the captain noted five to six eagles getting off the ground and flying dangerously close to the aircraft. He then requested the flight engineer to check if the flood lights were ON and to monitor the engine parameters. The crew asserted that they observed a rising and narrowing runway as the aircraft accelerated to a speed of 180 km/hr. At that time the crew noticed a flock of eagles ahead. The captain took control of the aircraft and decided, after assessing the situation within 4 seconds that the best option for the crew was to discontinue the take-off.At that moment, the crew heard a bang, which they suggested could be a bird strike. This was followed by aural and visual indications on the annunciator panel such as ""Left Engine Failure"", ""Dangerous Vibration"", and ""Take-off is prohibited"" and the captain immediately initiated a rejected take-off and instructed the flight engineer to deploy thrust reversers. The rejected take-off was initiated about 5 seconds after sighting the birds, at a speed of 220km/h. According to the captain, his decision was necessitated by the consideration of losing multiple engines due to bird strike if the take-off continued.The captain said he pressed the brake pedals completely immediately after initiating the rejected take-off, subsequently he assessed the braking action as not effective and he used the emergency braking at a speed of about 130 km/h. On realizing that the aircraft would not stop within the remaining available runway length coupled with the presence of a ravine at the end, the captain intentionally veered to the right in order to extend the runway stopping distance and also avoid the ravine. The aircraft exited the runway at a speed of approximately 76 km/h. As the aircrafts speed decayed to 60 km/h and just before the aircraft exited the runway, the captain instructed the flight engineer to close the fuel emergency shutoff cock. The aircraft travelled a distance of about 95m from the exit point before plunging into the ravine. In the process, the forward fuselage separated from the bulkhead located immediately after the cockpit section.The aircraft was destroyed but only one of the six crew members suffered minor injuries.An investigation showed fragments of bird feathers in the engines, belonging to the Common Honey Buzzard.Causal FactorThe investigation determines that the cause of this accident asDue to the presence of birds on the runway, the take-off was rejected at a speed above decision speed V1, which is inconsistent with CAVOKs Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).Contributory factorsThe contributory factors to this accident include but are not limited to the followingi. Failure of the crew to deploy interceptors (speed brakes/spoilers).ii. Inadequate flight crew training on details of rejected take-off procedure scenarios.iii. The omission of the take-off briefing in CAVOKs Normal Operations checklist.iv.

According to the Technical Log, the aircraft was serviceable when it arrived at Port Moresby at 0731 hours.The aircraft was scheduled for flight PX864, from Port Moresby to Tari on the same day. The pilots carried out a normal pre-flight inspection of the aircraft before it was released to service by the licensed engineer on duty. After obtaining a clearance from air traffic control (ATC), P2-ANK departed from runway 14L at 0904, then made a right turn, and commenced tracking on the 298°R of the Port Moresby VOR for Tari, under IFR procedures. There were 28 passengers, two pilots, and one flight attendant on board. At about 0920 while 39 nm west-northwest of Port Moresby and passing 20,000 ft during the climb, both pilots heard a bang sound, and felt the aircraft shudder.The copilot reported that he first thought that it was an engine failure. However, visual checks of the engines and instrument gauges showed that both engines were operating normally. He then did a further quick scan of the instrument panel and said that he saw the ""unsafe left hand main landing gear door indication"" amber light illuminated. He said that he immediately advised the pilot in command (PIC). The copilot then informed ATC of their intention to return to Port Moresby, and that a normal approach and landing was expected. The flight attendant then alerted both pilots that the left main landing gear door was open. That confirmed the reason for the illuminated left main landing gear door OPEN Advisory light. The PIC referred to the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) as a precaution, and descended to remain below 15,000 ft, and not above 130 knots.At 10 nm from Port Moresby, the copilot requested clearance from ATC to track west of Port Moresby to the Daugo Island area, to hold for 30-40 minutes and burn-off fuel, due to the maximum allowable landing weight.After burning off the excess fuel to achieve a landing weight of 15,650 kgs, they requested a clearance from ATC to continue descent to Jacksons for a landing.After obtaining a clearance to land the copilot selected the landing gear down. With the landing gear fully extended, the cockpit indication was three green lights illuminated. The copilot conducted a cross-check against the alternate landing gear selection, which showed three green lights illuminated. They proceed to land, assured that the nose- and main- landing gear were safe. At 1046, the aircraft landed on runway 14L, and was cleared to cross runway 14R to the parking area.The PIC reported that it was at that moment they realized that everyone on the tarmac was looking at the aircraft, particularly the left side. It wasnt until the passengers and the crew disembarked, that the crew were advised by the engineers that panels were missing aft of the left exhaust nacelle.Further inspection found that the left main landing gear number-two tyre was deflated and damaged. It was apparent that when the tyre blew out in the wheel well, it caused substantial damage to the main structure on the inside of the nacelle. It was then the crew realised that the bang sound they heard was the tyre exploding in flight at 20,000 ft.It is likely that the FOD damage occurred when a jagged rock impacted the non-serial sidewall of the number two tyre during the landing at Bulolo on 3 August 2017. The aircraft returned to Jacksons safely, but the damage was not found during post-and pre-flight inspections. During the subsequent flight after departure from Jacksons on 4 August, the casing plies in the impacted area fractured, propagating from the serial side sidewall along the cord direction to tread area and the non-serial side sidewall. It is likely that the significantly damaged and weakened casing of the tyre, and the differential of the atmospheric pressure compared with the pressure within the tyre, caused the tyre to blow out, resulting in substantial damage to the left nacelle.04-08-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2017

The two pilots and mechanic were not injured. The airplane flew under contract with the United States Forest Service. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the local flight. According to the pilot-in-command (PIC), the flight departed on its third mission to disperse fire retardant over a nearby wildfire. During the airplane's climb, the flight crew increased the airplane's nose up pitch by a few more degrees and the PIC subsequently responded with increasing nose down pressure. However, the down pressure control input required additional force, so the PIC used trim inputs to reduce the pressure. Moments later he observed an uncommanded aft movement of the control yoke with a simultaneous increase in the airplane's pitch attitude. He instructed the first officer (FO) to retract the flaps while he re-trimmed the elevator, but they were not able to regain pitch control. The FO attempted to adjust his trim wheel and then re-trim the airplane using the emergency varicam, but the airplane continued to maintain a pitch up attitude. He then deployed 5° of flaps at the PIC's instruction, which reduced the elevator backpressure. The PIC subsequently jettisoned the load of fire retardant over vacant farm land and then asked the FO to declare an emergency with the tower controller while the PIC entered a shallow left turn to intercept the downwind leg for runway 21. As he made his control inputs he determined that the elevator was bound, as he received little response from the elevator control. As the PIC had previously demonstrated the ability to land without making any adjustments to power or pitch in flight training, he elected to configure the airplane for an approach without trim or elevator control. The flight crew flew a wide traffic pattern and made small adjustments to compensate for altitude. During the final approach leg, the PIC used a combination of wing flaps and engine power for pitch up adjustments, and the crew coordinated application of elevator for trimmed pitch and turns to make their pitch down adjustments. As the airplane reached about 500 feet above ground level, the flight crew deployed the airplane's remaining 5° of flaps to increase the pitch attitude. Both the PIC and FO pulled hard on the yoke while the FO gently retarded the throttles and the PIC trimmed the emergency varicam. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed damage to the varicam. As this secondary control surface is directly connected to the elevators and provides a primary structural load path for all elevator loads, the damage was classified as substantial. Further examination of the varicam showed that one of the varicam actuator's outboard drive stop bolts had backed out of the drive coupling, and that the two bolts had not been safety wired. The airplane did not sustain any damage during the airplane's landing.PROBABLE CAUSE ""Maintenance personnel's failure to secure hardware, which resulted in an uncommanded upward deflection of the left elevator and aft movement of the control yoke and inhibited the flight crew from adjusting the airplane's pitch attitude in flight. Contributing to the accident was the lack of maintenance oversight, which should have identified the unsecured hardware before flight.""05-08-201705-08-2017",Fire fighting,NTSB ,2017

The Boeing 767 was being marshalled onto gate 69B after arrival and was instructed to stop approximately 15 feet short of the stop line because it is normally a tow-in gate. The flight crew shut down the engines and awaited the ground crew to hook up the tow bar. There are white lines painted around each gate area to aid ground vehicles driving on the ramp. The B767 tail protruded beyond the white lines perpendicular to, and adjacent to, taxiway C. The Boeing 737 was taxiing out for departure via taxiway C in accordance with ATC instructions. The captain reported that he saw the B767 and maneuvered left of centerline for more clearance. However, the NTSB reports that surveillance video from Gate 69B showed that the B737 nosewheel was tracking along the yellow centerline of taxiway C.The captain asked the first officer (FO), who was heads down making FMS entries, to look and verify if they had enough clearance. The FO reported he saw that the B767 was hooked up to the tug but wasn't sure if it was being towed. He judged that there was about 5 feet of clearance.

The airplane received substantial damage to the left wing and the tug canopy section was damaged. The tug driver was seriously injured and there were no injuries to the 53 passengers and crew onboard the CRJ-200. Weather was daytime visual meteorological conditions. After landing on runway 18R, the airplane was instructed to taxi to Gate E4. While taxiing in a narrow alleyway near the north end of concourse E, between the concourse and the baggage transfer point, the ground tug impacted the left wingtip. The tug was driving on non-movement area of the terminal ramp. The baggage tug was slightly in front of the aircraft at about a 10 o'clock position to the captain of the aircraft. A terminal road crosses the taxi alleyway from near Gate E38 to the beginning of area designated as the baggage transfer point. The transfer point is located outside the alleyway and is lined with concrete barriers. Airplane taxi within the alleyway and ground equipment travel perpendicular to aircraft movement when accessing the transfer point. As the tug turned onto the service road and began to cross the roadway he noticed the airplane taxing in the alley. The driver indicated that, in order to avoid a collision, he tightened his right turn in the opposite direction the airplane was traveling before colliding with the left hand wing. The canopy of the baggage tug was sheared off and the leading edge and winglet of the airplane was substantially damaged. The final resting place of the tug was just behind the trailing edge of the wing. There were skid marks from the airplane tires consistent with maximum braking starting when the airplane made contact with the baggage tug.

The aircraft, an Airbus A321-231, departed Miami International Airport at 1842 hours local time (2242 UTC). The flight was uneventful for the takeoff and cruise. A late descent clearance was obtained and the captain used 'selected speed' to descend at about 340 knots. The instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 was available and requested by the crew from the air traffic controller. The captain continued using 'selected speed' and speedbrakes until approximately 3,000 feet and 10 miles from the airport, at which point the airplane was configured for landing.Conditions at the time of the accident allowed the use of flaps 3, however, they decided to land flaps full, versus the American Airlines recommended current landing condition which would allow a flaps 3 position.At approximately 2000 feet, the captain selected 'managed speed' which subsequently resulted in a power increase to reach the last managed speed target of the descent phase which was 250 knots. The captain stated that he ""thought something was wrong with the airplane"" and disconnected the autopilot and autothrust, and increased the pitch of the airplane to avoid exceeding the limitation for the selected flaps. The captain subsequently hand flew the remainder of the approach.At 500 feet, the airplane was below the required approach speed and therefore did not meet the American Airlines' standard for a stabilized approach.The first officer provided a verbal notice to the captain of ""a little slow"" and the captain manually increased the engine thrust. The first officer made another verbal notice to the captain about the speed; however, the captain did not respond to that call. During this time, the airplane descended to about 1/2 dot low on the glideslope and the first officer called ""a little low"". The first officer reported that below 500 feet he was looking outside more than inside the cockpit and provided no further verbal prompts to the captain, until after touchdown.At approximately 50 feet, the aircraft had reached about 10 degrees nose up pitch and the speed continued to decay through 120 knots. The airplane provided a ""PITCH PITCH"" aural alert almost simultaneously with touchdown which occurred at 110 knots and about 10 degrees of pitch up attitude.After landing skin damage was observed to the lower tail section of the airplane.Probable CauseThe airplane's tail made contact with the runway due to an excessive pitch attitude of about 10 degrees because the crew was unaware of the decaying airspeed.Contributing to the tail strike were the following- the flight crew's failure to identify the fact that approach phase had not been activated during the initial approach phase- the flight crew's failure to understand the automation- the fact that the flight was unstabilized below 500 feet- the night crew's failure to initiate a go-around maneuver- the overall lack of clear communication and adequate use of Crew Resource Management (CRM).",International Scheduled Passenger,,2017
15-SEP-2017,Boeing 737-8AS (WL),EI-DLV,Ryanair,0,London-Stans...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20170915-1,Takeoff (TOF),Minor,Runway mishap,"Ryanair flight 7384, a Boeing 737-800, was pushed back off Stand 43R at London-Stansted Airport, with the commander acting as pilot flying, and was cleared to taxi via taxiway C to holding point S1 for runway 22.The crew reported there was nothing abnormal during the taxi and, on reaching S1, they held in turn before being cleared by ATC to line up and hold. As the aircraft entered the runway, ATC cleared the crew to take off. The commander taxied the nose of the aircraft beyond the centreline to line up on the centre of the runway for a rolling takeoff. As he did so, the flight crew heard a noise similar to the nosewheels passing over a runway centre light. The same noise was heard by the two cabin crew members at the front of the cabin.Neither the pilots nor the two cabin crew members considered the noise to be anything out of the ordinary.The commander reported that during the takeoff roll, despite there only being a light wind at the time, he used aileron and rudder to keep the aircraft straight on the centreline, as if the aircraft was experiencing a crosswind from the right. The takeoff otherwise appeared normal to the flight crew and, after rotation, the gear was raised with no apparent problems.They continued with the CLN 1E departure given by ATC, before being given a radar heading and climb to FL170.An aircraft operating on a different radio frequency to EI-DLV and waiting at the S1 hold, informed ATC that, as EI-DLV had started its takeoff roll, they had seen one of the nosewheels depart the aircraft and be blown off the runway into the area behind the threshold. They could also see what appeared to be a part of the aircraft on the runway.ATC ordered a check of the runway and the aircraft parts were recovered. When ATC notified EI-DLV of what had happened, the aircraft was passing about FL110. The crew entered a hold whilst they assessed the situation. The most appropriate guidance they could find in the aircraft manuals was for landing with a flat tyre in the Flight Crew Training Manual, which they elected to follow. The crew decided their best option was to return to Stansted, a decision agreed when they contacted the companys engineering base at the airport by radio. The flight crew informed ATC of their intention to return to Stansted and the commander gave the cabin supervisor an emergency brief before advising the passengers of the situation over the PA.Having prepared the aircraft for the approach, the crew was cleared by ATC to descend and head towards the ABBOT holding and arrival point for Stansted. Shortly afterwards ATC contacted the crew to inform them that the aircraft operator had requested that the aircraft now divert to either East Midlands or Prestwick, rather than Stansted. As this conflicted with the request from the engineering base, on arrival at ABBOT the crew took up the hold in order to contact the company Operations Department by radio via their ground handling agent at Stansted. The Operations Department confirmed the new diversion preferences and the crew determined they had sufficient fuel to divert to East Midlands. The crew then re-briefed and set the aircraft up for a diversion to East Midlands before advising ATC of the new diversion request, at which time they also declared a PAN.The weather report for East Midlands was for light winds, good visibility and a broken cloud base of 3,700 feet aal.ATC gave the crew vectors to establish on the ILS for runway 27 at East Midlands Airport.When established on the approach, the crew flew a CAT 1 ILS, lowering the gear early; the gear operated normally and gave the normal indications. They elected to use full flaps (flaps 40) for landing to give a lower touchdown speed and calculated that autobrake 2 was the lowest usable autobrake selection they could use, as advised in the guidance they had consulted earlier. The commander disengaged the autopilot just below 500 feet aal and, on touchdown, lowered the nosewheel as gently as possible onto the runway. He reported the landing appeared normal and that he stopped the aircraft on the runway. The fire service attended quickly; they inspected the aircraft and confirmed that one of the nosewheels was missing. The commander decided against taxiing the aircraft off the runway as the taxiway entrances ahead of them were all at 90° to the runway and he was concerned about putting stress on the remaining wheel. The engines were shut down and the passengers were deplaned onto buses before the aircraft was towed to a stand.ConclusionThe nosewheel was found to have separated from the aircraft because the NLG axle had failed at the left inboard journal. The failure was caused by a crack that had initiated near the 6 oclock position of the journal and had then propagated over time via fatigue and SCC until the remaining material failed in overload. The crack was the result of heat-induced cracking and material property changes caused by abusive grinding of the chrome plate during the parts last overhaul.The cause of the abusive grinding could not be determined, but the abusive grinding would probably have been identified if a post-grinding Barkhausen inspection had been carried out.15-09-2017",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2017

A Fly-in & Car Show event was taking place at the time, and several areas on the ramp were occupied by the show. The pilot was then instructed by ground control to follow a truck on A6 taxiway to transient parking. The transient parking was moved to the east side of the ramp and was only accessible by taxiway A6 during the event. The pilot stated that as he followed the truck, he noticed several airplanes that were parked to the right side and their wings overhung into the taxiway near to the centerline. As he approached the airplanes he steered left of centerline to maintain clearance to his right. He had one ground personnel to the right side clearing the airplane's right wing and no one on the left side to clear the left wing.

Upon landing on runway 25 at Kuching International Airport, the aircraft experienced runway excursion to the right of the runway pavement. The weather was cloudy and heavy downpour with cross-wind from the left during the final phase of the landing and also during landing roll.The aircraft travelled approximately 600 meters on the soft ground parallel to the runway before coming to a stop parallel to the runway heading of 255 degrees. The nose gear collapsed just before the aircraft came to a complete halt position.Probable Cause1 Sudden Increase in the intensity of rain while flaring to land resulted in the significant reduction of the PF visual reference. Without the visual contact with runway centerline, the PF was not able to detect the lateral movement or heading change of the aircraft, therefore, the PF was unable to correct the displacement away from the runway centerline. The drift was also compounded by the sudden increase of strong crosswind from the left.2 The PF had likely lost his positional and directional awareness with reference to the runway due to the degraded visibility, hence, he did not exert sufficient and timely rudder application to regain the runway centerline before departing the paved portion of the runway.Contributory Factors1 Intensity of rain and wind speeds were increasing over the airfield throughout the approach and landing.2 Inadequate risk assessment on the prevailing weather conditions made by the flight crews through the established TEM briefing.3 Lack of alertness in recognizing the abnormal situation and assertiveness by the PM in getting the attention of the PF to the developing and impending deviation from centerline.4 Currently, there is no standard callout in OM (B) in regards to calling out for runway centerline deviation.",Unknown,AAIB Malaysia ,2017

The aeroplane took off at 0950 UTC with the three pilots (the captain and two first officers, FO/1 and FO/2) in the cockpit. The cruise altitude (FL 330) was reached around 25 minutes later. The crew agreed on the division of the rest time. FO/2 took the first duty period around 30 minutes after take-off. The aeroplane changed levels several times during the cruise and then stabilized at FL370 at 1114.At 1348, the crew asked Gander Oceanic to climb to FL380. The controller accepted and asked them to report when reaching FL380. The low pressure compressor and turbine rotation speed (N1) of the four engines increased from 98% to 107%.At 1349, the titanium fan hub of the right outer engine (No 4) separated into at least three parts. This failure was the result of the progression of a crack originating in the parts subsurface. The central fragment of the hub stayed attached to the coupling shaft between the low pressure compressor and the low pressure turbine. The two other hub fragments were ejected, one upwards and the other downwards. The interaction between the liberated fan rotor fragments and the fixed parts of the engine caused the destruction of the engine casing and the separation of the air inlet which fell to the ground. Debris struck the wing and airframe without affecting the continuation of the flight.After the failure, the aeroplanes heading increased by three degrees to the right in three seconds, and there were vibrations in the airframe for around four seconds.The  crew perceived these variations and associated them with engine surging by analogy with the sensations reproduced in simulator sessions. An ""ENG 4 STALL"" ECAM message came up. The captain requested the ""ECAM actions"". He engaged Autopilot 1 and indicated that he was taking the controls and would thus be Pilot Flying. He reduced engine No 4 thrust by positioning the associated lever to IDLE. The engine performed an automatic shutdown and the FO/2 confirmed the sequence by depressing the Engine 4 Master and Engine 4 fire pushbuttons, a few seconds later.The damaged engine could not be seen from the cockpit or in the image from the  camera located on the fin of the A380. A member of the cabin crew brought to the cockpit, a photo of the engine taken by a passenger with his smartphone.FO/1 who had returned to the cockpit to help the flight crew on duty, went to the upper deck to assess the damage and take other photos. He observed damage on the leading edge slats and small vibrations in the flaps. From the time of the failure and for around 1 min 30 s, the CAS had decreased from 277 kt to 258 kt and level flight at FL370 was maintained. The captain noticed this  reduction in speed and decided to descend to the drift-down level calculated by the FMS (EO MAX FL 346) to maintain a constant speed in level flight. Observing that it was not possible to hold this level and this speed, he continued descending level by level. He selected FL 360, FL 350 then FL 330 and lastly FL 310. The level by level descent obliged the crew to stop their ECAM actions each time a descent was initiated. During level flight at FL310, the N1 rotation speeds of the three remaining engines decreased to 103%. The captain stabilized the descent to FL290 with a constant speed (CAS was 290 kt) by keeping the three engines in maximum continuous thrust (MCT). He decided to continue the descent and stabilize at FL270 in order to spare the engines to destination. The speed stabilized at 279 kt. Around five minutes after the A380 had started its descent, the controller in the Gander Oceanic control centre with which the crew were in datalink contact (CPDLC), detected the deviation from the vertical profile of the path and sent a message ""ATC NOW SHOWS YOU FL330. IS THERE A PROBLEM"".At the same time, the control centre received an audio Mayday message from AF066, relayed by another aeroplane. One minute later, the PM replied to the CPDLC question with a MAYDAY. Direct audio communication between the flight and ATC resumed a few minutes later.The crew decided, in agreement with Air France's Operational Control Centre , to divert to Goose Bay airport and asked the controller for a direct route. After studying the available approaches and taking into consideration the captains experience and the airports immediate environment, the crew confirmed the selection of Goose Bay airport as the alternate airfield even though it was at a greater distance than Kangerlussuaq airport in Greenland.The crew started the descent to Goose Bay and were cleared to carry out the RNAV GNSS RWY 26 approach. They were then cleared to land on runway 26. They configured the aeroplane for landing. On approaching the altitude of 1,000 ft, the captain disconnected Autopilot 1 and the flight director (FD) and continued the landing in manual flight. The aeroplane landed at 1542. The taxiing phase to the stand took some time due to having to stop several times so that the airport services could collect the debris which had fallen onto the runway during the landing. At 1622, all the engines were shut down.Contributing factorsThe following factors may have contributed to the failure of the fan hub on engine No 4- engine designers/manufacturers lack of knowledge of the cold dwell fatigue phenomenon in the titanium alloy, Ti-6-4;- absence of instructions from the certification bodies about taking into accout macro-zones and the cold dwell fatigue phenomenon in the critical parts of an engine, when demonstrating conformity;- absence of non-destructive means to detect the presence of unusual macro-zone in titanium alloy parts;- an increase in the risk of having large macro-zones with increased intensity in th Ti-6-4 due to bigger engines, and in particular, bigger fans.30-09-201730-09-201730-09-201730-09-201730-09-201730-09-201730-09-2017",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2017

According to the crew, at 300ft the aircraft was configured for landing with full flaps and propeller levers at the full forward position. Wind shield wipers were turned on due to the light rain. The visibility deteriorated when the aircraft approached to land. Right after the aircraft first contacted water, the visibility briefly dropped to near zero due to heavy rain.The aircraft touched down in the intended landing area, on the left float first and bounced, then contacted the water a second time on the right float. The co-pilot reduced power by pulling the power levers back. At the same time, as stated by the captain, he placed his right hand on the power levers (over the co-pilots left hand) and pushed the power levers fully forward, applying full power with the intention of going around whilst calling ""Max power"". The captain neither announced that he was taking over control, nor called for flaps 10°, as per the procedures. There was no response from the co-pilot in handing over of controls to the captain. The aircraft banked sharply to the right, turning right and crashed. The aircraft finally flipped over and came to rest upside down, facing south and was partly submerged.All passengers and crew evacuated safely through the right hand emergency exit, which was above the water.Causesa. Improper recovery techniques from a bounced landing; application of go-around procedures whilst the aircraft was at low speed with flaps fully extended.b. Breakdown of crew coordination during the attempted go-around.c. Poor judgement of approaching inclement weather condition; crew decided to land, hoping that they could make it before the approaching storm strikes the landing area.29 Nov. 19799N-ABQde Havilland Canada12 Dec. 19799N-ABQRoyal Nepal Airlines31 May 19979N-ABQRoyal Nepal Airlines19 Aug. 20029N-ABQRoyal Nepal Airlinesca 20029N-ABQRoyal Nepal Airlines3 Jan. 20129N-ABQTara Air19 Aug. 20129N-ABQTara Air21 Sep. 20129N-ABQTara AirJune 20159N-AKMTara Air29 Jan. 2016N106WFAerostar Bravo Ltd24 Oct. 20168Q-ISBMaldivian",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AICC Maldives ,2017

The flight between Mogadishu and Baidoa was uneventful. At 1130 hours, the pilot took off from Baidoa with eight passengers onboard and landed safely at Xuddur at 1203 hours.  At Xuddur, four passengers disembarked with their cargo and the pilot picked four other passengers with their cargo. As the pilot was preparing for take-off from Xuddur to Elberde there appeared to be some disagreements among the local agents about the cargo which was onboard the aircraft. The pilot was made to temporary suspend the take-off as the agents tried to sort out their differences. According to the pilot, there seemed to be unclear decision among the agents on whether to allow the pilot to proceed with the take-off or stop as the pilot was instructed to stop twice after being allowed to take off.A few moments later, the pilot decided to take-off after a group of Somali soldiers, local police, Ethiopian soldiers and the local agents had moved away from the aircraft. As soon as the pilot started taxing the aircraft for take-off two armed men came running brandishing guns towards the aircraft and started firing rapidly at the aircraft as the pilot continued with the take-off. The aircraft had gained some speed when the pilot decided to abort the take-off. As the pilot tried to abort the take-off the aircraft veered off the runway and collided with a building nearby before it stopped. All the occupants exited the aircraft using the rear door.

The captain was Pilot Not Flying (PNF), the copilot was Pilot Flying (PF).At 0643, the aircraft entered Abidjan's airspace. At 0755, the crew was cleared for an ILS Z runway 21 approach procedure, and to descend to 2700 ft, report passing FL50. Four minutes later, the Regional Control Centre called the crew back to inform them that the current procedure now was the VOR Z runway 03 approach. Weather was reported a wind from 40° at 12kt, visibility 4000m, light rain, scattered clouds at 150m and 330m, some cumulonimbus at 600m. The flight crew then prepared for the approach and turned down an offer to use runway 21 as the wind had changed direction to 060° at 13kt.At 0805, the crew contacted the Tower and informed it that they were descending through FL50 towards runway 03. The Tower Controller cleared him to descend to 2200 ft. As the flight continued, the PNF reported not being able to receive the VOR.At 0816 the flight turned onto the final approach heading and at 11 nautical miles out, the PNF instructed the Pilot Flying to use the GPS. At 0820, the crew informed the Tower that they were passing 7 NM and were cleared to land on runway 03 by the controller, who informed them of a wind of 040°/10kt. In between clouds the crew observed boats on the water below them. Visibility decreased and the Tower controller increased the brightness of the runway edge and PAPI lights. Descent was continued although the crew was not able to see the runway ahead. After passing Decision Altitude the PNF confirmed the crew's intentions to land. The aircraft descended until it struck the surface of the sea, about 800 meters short of the threshold of runway 03. The aircraft broke in three upon impact. All three flight crew members and one passenger died.Causes of the accidentThe probable cause of this accident is the continuation of the approach below minimums without having established formal visual contact with runway references and without adequate monitoring of the aircraft's glide path. The rigorous application of the company SOPs should have necessarily led to a go-around.The following factors contributed to the accident- Underestimation of adverse weather conditions below minimums;- A lack of knowledge of the environment of Abidjan airport and insufficient awareness of the aircraft's vertical position;- Inadequate monitoring of aircraft instruments and flight path (altitude and speed) in degraded weather conditions;- A high workload due to continued final approach training and distraction from tasks not related to flight operations;- Disabling EGPWS audible alerts due to unwanted alarms;- Crew resource management (CRM) probably unbalanced by the authority of the PNF over the rest of the crew.- Strict non-compliance with company SOPs.",Cargo, ,2017

The aircraft was scheduled to operate a passenger flight to Melbourne, Victoria, with two flight crew, five cabin crew, and 174 passengers.After boarding, the flight crew found the aircraft had no battery power, as the battery switch had inadvertently been left on. Consequently, another Boeing 737 aircraft, registered VH-VZZ (VZZ) was assigned for the flight. Catering had already been loaded on the originally assigned aircraft so a catering crew (driver and marshaller) were tasked to transfer the catering to VZZ.At about 1910, a dispatch engineer was assigned to the departure of VZZ, which was scheduled for 1930.At about 1921, the engineer arrived at the aircraft, and received a handover from the other engineer who had been in attendance. The engineers discussed the aircraft status under the aerobridge as it had just started to rain. At this time, the catering vehicle (truck) was loading the forward galley through the right forward main entry door. The pushback vehicle's (tug) towbar was already connected to the aircraft.At about 1922, the catering crew completed loading the forward galley. They then moved the truck to the right rear main entry door and began loading the rear galley.The engineer completed his walk around of VZZ and stood under the wing waiting for the catering crew to complete loading. He saw the catering crew close the main entry door and then visually checked that the aircraft door was closed.The engineer then proceeded towards the front of the aircraft. He put on his headset, which was connected to an external jack point, and contacted the flight crew who confirmed they were ready to depart. As it was still raining, the engineer entered the right side of the tug and sat in its cabin. Meanwhile, the catering crew retracted the truck's loading platform and began lowering the truck's body.At about 1930, air traffic control cleared VZZ for pushback, and its captain informed the engineer accordingly. When the aerobridge had been retracted, the engineer leaned out of the tug cabin and completed a visual check of the left forward main entry door.At 193223, the catering truck body had finished lowering and the stabilisers began to raise. The crew exited the truck body. A few seconds later, the flight crew turned on the aircraft's anti-collision light.At 193243, the engineer looked left and right from the tug cabin to check for vehicles. He then gave the 'thumbs up' signal to the tug driver to commence pushback. When VZZ began reversing, the engineer approved the flight crew to start the right engine. The crew selected the engine start switch and the engine began rotating. The catering truck driver began reversing the truck at this time.A few seconds later, the catering truck's marshaller identified that VZZ was moving and tried to alert the truck driver. At the same time, the engineer saw that the catering truck was not clear and 'yelled' at the tug driver to stop. The tug driver immediately applied the brakes. The tug stopped but the pins in the towbar sheared and it separated from VZZ.The flight crew heard a loud 'bang' and then saw VZZ moving away from the tug. The catering truck was reversing but still 5-7 m behind the aircraft's right engine so the engineer asked the flight crew to apply the aircraft's brakes. The captain applied the brakes as firmly as possible. The aircraft slowed but continued rolling back 3-4 m.At 193253, the aircraft's right wing collided with the truck before it came to a stop. The flight crew then engaged the aircraft's park brake and turned the right engine switch to OFF and the engine wound down as fuel had not been introduced.The aircraft was found to have substantial damage to its right outboard flaps, wing structure between the flaps and aileron, and the aileron.Findings- The dispatch engineer assumed that the catering truck was clear and did not visually confirm it was before he cleared VH-VZZ for pushback. In part, this assumption was based on an incorrect expectation of the time required for the truck to move clear.- The engineers view of the truck from the pushback tugs cabin was largely obstructed by the aircraft. The dark and rainy conditions also made it difficult to see the truck, and the engineer saw it too late to prevent the collision.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ATSB ,2017

The captain was Pilot Flying.The descent checks and approach briefing for runway 22 had been completed and the aircraft was descending through FL150 to the south of Hawarden when the flight crew started to notice a burning smell. It appeared to them that the smell was coming from the air vents on the flight deck. They donned their oxygen masks and attempted to verify communication between themselves, but found it difficult because of high noise levels coming through the cockpit speakers.The co-pilot declared a MAYDAY to ATC, advising of a burning smell and their intention to continue to land at Hawarden. The commander contacted the cabin crew member on the interphone. She was hardly able to hear his message but understood that they were carrying out an emergency descent and went to check and secure the cabin. When he contacted her again she could not hear any of the message so she entered the flight deck. The commander gave her an emergency briefing, advising her that the aircraft would be landing in 10 minutes and to standby for instructions after landing. The noise levels through the cockpit speaker remained high and when the commander spoke or attempted a transmission there was a strong feedback signal.The approach and landing on runway 22 was completed and the commander taxied the aircraft clear of the runway, turning north onto adjacent taxiway D, and brought it to a stop. He did not know if he could contact the cabin crew member and was uncertain of the conditions in the passenger cabin, so he decided an emergency evacuation should be carried out. He shut down the engines and made a PA announcement to the cabin to initiate the emergency evacuation.After the commander made the evacuation announcement to the cabin, the engines continued to operate at idle power for 8 seconds before they started to run down; the propellers continued turning for a further 40 seconds. The forward cabin door and the two mid-cabin over wing emergency exits were opened by the passengers. The right over wing exit door was dropped to the ground behind the wing and blown forwards by the wind into the still rotating right propeller. The aft cabin exit door was opened by the cabin crew member; it fell to the ground and was blown rearwards by the propeller wash from the right engine.The passengers exited the aircraft and, once they had checked the cabin was clear, the crew followed. There was one minor injury. The burning smell was as a result of smoke and dust carried in the atmosphere from North Africa and Iberia.During 16 and 17 October the AAIB received 32 notifications of Smoke/Fume events affecting aircraft in UK airspace and the UK CAA received in excess of 60 reports. Of the 32 events reported to the AAIB, smoke/fumes were initially detected by flight and cabin crew members at altitudes from between 2,000 ft and FL200.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2017

The aircraft touched the water with its landing gear extended and it overturned. One of the passengers sustained fatal injuries.2 Contributing factors.- Attitude - a contributor.Failure to comply with the checklist during the pre-flight inspection and the flight itself favored the landing with inadequate configuration. This attitude may have been triggered by the pilot's confidence in his operational capability, because of his long experience in aviation.- Flight indiscipline - a contributor.Failure to comply with the checklist indicated, in addition to the low level of situational awareness, a low level of concern for the safe conduction of the flight by failing to follow basic procedures set forth in the manufacturer's manuals and current regulations.- Piloting judgement - a contributor.The pilot's choice not to use the checklist during the flight phases revealed an inadequate evaluation of parameters related to the operation of the aircraft. Improper compliance with the items in the Pre-Flight Inspection Sheet prevented the AMPHIB PUMP 1 and 2 circuit breakers from being rearmed.- Aircraft maintenance - a contributor.After performing the test of landing gear extension and retraction by the emergency system, the AMPHIB PUMP 1 and 2 circuit breakers were not rearmed, being the aircraft delivered to fly in this condition The setting recorded on the AIRSPEED switch of the landing gear position warning system computer demonstrated that the scheduled speed of 74kt was not in accordancewith the recommended in the 9600-1A installation manual of Wipaire Inc. in its revision G.- Memory - undetermined.The AMPHIB PUMP 1 and 2 circuit breakers were found disarmed after the occurrence, indicating that, after the completion of the maintenance service, the executor of the tasks probably forgot to comply with the procedures for reconfiguring the aircraft. In addition, it is possible that the pilot's automatism in relation to his way of carrying out the air operations, without the use of the checklist, has prevented the correct perception of the circuit breakers condition and the erroneous positioning of the landing gear.- Perception - a contributor.The accomplishment of the landing on the water with the aircraft in inadequate configuration for the situation denotes a decrease in the level of situational awareness of the pilot, considering that the necessary factors and conditions for the safety of the operation were not observed.17-10-2017",Survey/research,CENIPA ,2017

As the flight descended through about 4,000 feet msl, towards Anchorage, the captain visually confirmed that the airport was in sight, and requested a visual approach. He reported the air traffic controller didn't respond to his initial request, and he requested a visual approach again. The controller responded back with a vector for the instrument landing system (ILS) runway 7R approach. The pilot reported his groundspeed was about 210 knots indicated, he joined the final approach course, and was cleared to land.

Initial repairs and the number 2 engine replacement were made in Gatwick and the aircraft was ferried back to Toronto on November 8.",International Scheduled Passenger,,2017
02-NOV-2017,Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III,C-FLRY,Perimeter Aviation,0,Thompson Air...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20171102-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Runway excursion,"On 31 October 2017, a Perimeter Aviation Metro III, registration C-FLRY, was operating as flight 959 from Winnipeg-James Armstrong Richardson International Airport to Gods River Airport, Canada. After landing and selecting the speed levers low for taxi, the crew received a crew alerting system warning for the left engine oil pressure. The aircraft was then taxied to the ramp and a normal engine shutdown was performed.The pilot checked the oil level in the left engine and discovered it to be low. A maintenance crew was dispatched to Gods River to inspect and repair the oil pressure issue. After arriving, the maintenance crew added 3 quarts of oil and an inspection of the left engine revealed oil leaking from the engine oil pressure snubber. The aircraft was then parked overnight and arrangements were made to get the parts needed for the repair.The next day, on 1 November 2017, a new maintenance crew arrived with the required parts and replaced the left engine oil pressure snubber. Following a test run of the left engine, there was no evidence of an oil leak and maintenance released the aircraft back to service. During a pre-flight inspection, the aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) noticed a hydraulic fluid leak. The AME checked the hydraulic reservoir and found it to be low. An inspection of the hydraulic system did not reveal the source of the leak and the aircraft was once again parked overnight.On 2 November 2017, another maintenance and flight crew were sent to Gods River to address the hydraulic leak and fly the aircraft back to base. After a lengthy inspection and engine run, the maintenance crew could not identify the source of the hydraulic leak. It was determined that a ferry flight permit would be required to fly the aircraft to a company base at Thompson Airport, for further inspection and repair. The aircraft was then inspected and serviced to the degree necessary for the 50-minute flight. Hydraulic fluid was added to the reservoir, and 1 quart of oil was added to the left engine. The left engine and engine compartment were dry and did not show any signs of an oil leak. A ferry flight permit was then issued that stated the aircraft was to be flown with essential crew only and with the landing gear extended. The flight crew then contacted the assistant chief pilot for a pre-flight briefing that included the risk factors associated with the ferry flight and a discussion about potential emergencies and contingencies, including retracting the landing gear for emergency situations only.At approximately 1830 on 2 November 2017, the aircraft, operating as Perimeter flight 959, departed Gods River on the ferry flight to Thompson Airport with only the 2 flight crew members on board. Approximately 15 minutes after departure, the crew noticed the left engine oil pressure drop into the yellow band range. The crew then consulted with maintenance operations control in flight and it was decided that if the oil pressure dropped below the yellow band and the oil temperature increased beyond the green band, then the engine was to be shut down.The crew began executing the Preplanned Engine Shutdown checklist in the quick reference handbook (QRH) so that they would be prepared if the left engine indications changed. The crew retracted the landing gear to reduce drag and received a gear up-and-locked indication. Because the oil temperature remained in the green band, the crew paused the checklist at the point where the generators are to be turned off, and continued flying the aircraft with the left engine running. When the aircraft was approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Thompson Airport, the flight crew told air traffic control (ATC) that they had received a low oil pressure indication on the left engine and that the engine might need to be shut down. No emergency was declared, but aircraft rescue and firefighting services were put on standby.During the final approach to runway 24, the crew extended the landing gear. As the aircraft approached the runway threshold, the left engine rpm dropped to 96%. The pilot then adjusted the right engine rpm to counter the differential rpm. Although the left engine oil pressure dropped below the yellow band, the oil temperature indication did not rise and the crew elected to keep the engine running. It was reported that the left engine oil pressure dropped to 16 psi and the engine oil temperature indication never exceeded 88 °C.The aircraft's initial landing touchdown on runway 24 was on the right main gear, with both engines operating, approximately 1200 feet past the runway threshold. The captain pulled the power levers over the flight idle gate. An engine power surge was heard, and the aircraft began to pitch up and roll to the right. As the upset progressed, the right wing made contact with the runway and the aircraft pivoted around the right wingtip. The nose section then suddenly dropped to the ground and the aircraft came to rest off the runway, approximately 1800 feet past the runway threshold, in an upright position, facing the opposite direction with the engines still running. The engines were shut down using the engine stop and feather control, and the crew exited the aircraft via the left overwing emergency exit. There was no post-impact fire. The occurrence took place at 1920, during the hours of darkness. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, propellers, landing gear, and right wing.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The left engine low oil pressure indications during the previous and the occurrence flights were likely the result of a steady oil leak past the rear turbine air-oil seal assembly.2. The loss of engine oil pressure resulted in a loss of propeller control authority on landing and the upset of the aircraft.3. After consultation with maintenance, the crew considered the risks associated with landing single engine and without hydraulic pressure for the nose-wheel steering, and decided to continue the flight with both engines running, even though this was not consistent with the QRH procedures for low oil pressure indications.4. Carbon deposits that accumulated within the inside diameter of the bellows convolutions interfered with the bellows' ability to expand and to provide a positive seal against the rotor seal.",Ferry/positioning,TSB Canada ,2017

The aircraft was consumed by fire. One of the two pilots sustained fatal injuries.The aircraft had departed Ekimchan and was en route at an altitude of 1800 meters when the crew noticed a strong smell of gasoline in the cockpit. They decided to return to the departure aerodrome. During descent, the engine began running rough. Sparks and flames were observed. When approaching the airstrip at Ekimchan, the engine began losing power. At an altitude of about 50 meters, the engine stopped. Because of the presence of buildings in front of the aircraft, the crew executed the turn to the left. The aircraft impacted a wooded area, near the end of the runway.Conclusion (translated from Russian)The crash of An-2 RA-02305 aircraft occurred during the forced landing.The necessity of the forced landing was caused by the engine stopping in flight due to the destruction of the cylinder head No.1 of the ASH62-IR engine No.K16509153. The destruction of cylinder head No. 1 is of fatigue nature and occurred due to exhaustion of fatigue life of the cylinder head material and reaching its limit state.Most likely, during the last repair of the engine the crack in the cylinder head was present, but was not through and was not revealed during the inspection.The most likely contributing factor to stopping the engine in flight was the impoverishment of the fuel-air mixture due to icing of the BAC filter mesh and the presence of a rubber plug on the filter flange of the corrector.07-11-201707-11-2017",Cargo,MAK ,2017

At approximately 1938 during cruise flight at a height of 34000 ft (FL340) within South African airspace, a loud bang was heard on the flight deck and a subsequent right yaw was experienced. The crew observed an immediate visual indication on the cockpit engines instruments that engines no. 1 and 2 had experienced catastrophic failure. According to the flight recordings, the no. 1 engine failed first. This was due to damage to the full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) box, which had been struck by the turbine blades debris from engine no.2.Following the incident, the crew declared a MAYDAY call due to the instant failure of the two engines on the port wing, and immediately followed emergency operating procedures. Contact was made with the operator's maintenance control centre (MCC) to report and discuss the situation. A decision was then made by the crew following considered assessment of the situation to continue with the flight to the destination, a distance of approximately 240 nm. The aircraft landed uneventfully on runway 21R at 2039.It was found that that fourth-stage Low Pressure turbine rotor disc of engine no.2 had failed. The fourth-stage disc assembly was fitted on 27 July 2017 as a repaired unit which had a total of 11885 hours and 9419 cycles. During this disc change a wrong procedure was followed pre-SB (Service Bulletin) engine configuration type procedure was applied during a post SB engine configured installation. During replacement of the fourth-stage disc assembly, a retaining nut that had been fitted before was reused and a new locking cup was used.Probable CauseThe cause of the no2 engine uncontained failure was attributed to the LP turbine retaining nut becoming dislodged resulting on the fourth-stage turbine rotor disk disengaged from the LP turbine shaft. The fourth-stage turbine rotor disc compromised the turbine casing and turbine debris from the no. 2 engine struck the no. 1 engine, causing an un-commanded shutdown and leading to a catastrophic failure of both port-side engines.Contributory factor1.

At about 2050, while on approach to runway 26 at Toronto City Airport, the aircraft experienced turbulence. As a result, the airspeed fluctuated rapidly during the approach.Jazz standard operating procedures (SOPs) for stable approaches allow for a deviation of -5 to +10 knots from the planned approach speed once the aircraft is below 500 feet above ground level (AGL) on approach. However, the speed of the occurrence aircrafts approach varied from 119 to 141 knots. Because the speed deviations resulted from momentary wind gusts, the flight crew considered the approach to be stable.Once the aircraft was below 100 feet AGL on approach, it encountered momentary wind shear as a result of a wind gust, causing its airspeed to decrease. The aircraft touched down and the pilots reacted by advancing the power levers to a maximum of 42.5% and 40% on the left and right engines, respectively.The airplane was then caught in a wind shear, causing the airspeed to increase. The power levers were retarded through the flight idle gate position to the propeller discing detent position. However, the momentary increase in torque and airspeed caused the aircraft to become airborne again, up to 4.5 feet above the runway, for about 2.75 seconds.The propeller blade angles moved through the ground-idle range into the disc position, which caused a significant loss of lift. The wind shear decreased, and the combined reduction in lift resulted in the aircraft firmly contacting the runway. The vertical loads on landing exceeded 5.5g, which is the force at which both flight recorders stop simultaneously. Subsequently, the FDR caution light illuminated. The aircraft then taxied to the gate as normal.Following consultation with the operators maintenance via telephone, the flight crew conducted a visual inspection of the aircraft; no abnormalities were detected. It was then decided that a hard landing maintenance inspection was not required, and the aircraft was dispatched under MEL authority for the FDR caution light that remained illuminated. After the departure on the return flight to Montreal, the flight crew requested that the aircraft be inspected on arrival due to a potential hard landing. When maintenance personnel in Montreal brought the aircraft into the hangar, airframe damage to the aft right fuselage and the right main landing gear was discovered.No probable cause statement was published by TSB Canada in this limited-scope, fact-gathering investigation.09-11-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2017

The first two sectors to London City and returning to Belfast City were flown without incident and with all the aircraft equipment and systems operating normally. Following a normal turnaround and flight preparation, the aircraft was refuelled and the passengers boarded. The weather was good with a surface wind of 260° at 12 kt, CAVOK with a temperature of +8°C and a dew point of +4°C. The aircraft was started and taxied for runway 22, from which it departed at 1118 hrs. Shortly after takeoff, the landing gear selector lever was selected to the up position. On the Landing Gear Control and Indication Panel (LGCIP) the crew observed that the landing gear green lights extinguished, the three red lights and the amber landing gear door lights as well as the amber light in the landing gear selector lever all illuminated. After a short time, all three red lights extinguished, the left and right door lights extinguished but the nose door light and the light in the landing gear selector lever remained illuminated. The crew kept the airspeed below the 185 kt landing gear limit speed and climbed to 4,000 feet, routing to waypoint Magee to take up the hold whilst they assessed the problem. The aircraft entered the hold at 1132 hrs and the total fuel onboard was 2,800 kg. Whilst in the hold, the crew initially actioned the LANDING GEAR FAIL TO RETRACT abnormal checklist followed by the LANDING GEAR FAIL TO INDICATE LOCKED DOWN abnormal checklist. The MLG lowered and indicated locked down, but the NLG showed the unsafe indication with the amber nose door light still illuminated. The landing gear inoperative (ldg gear inop) caption also illuminated on the Caution and Warning Annunciator Panel. They actioned the ALTERNATE LANDING GEAR EXTENSION abnormal checklist and made several attempts to operate the nose landing gear alternate release handle but the indications remained the same. They reviewed the EMERGENCY LANDING - ONE OR BOTH ENGINES OPERATING abnormal checklist and decided to divert to Belfast International Airport. At this stage, the crew did not know if the NLG was up or down. The crew sought advice from their company and this confirmed their decision to go to Belfast International Airport. They reviewed the fuel and decided to leave the hold with 1,100 kg which would minimise the fuel onboard at touchdown but ensure sufficient fuel to carry out a go-around if required. The Senior Cabin Crew Member (SCCM) was called to the flight deck and the situation explained to her along with a briefing which included the procedure for an emergency evacuation, should it be required. Passengers seated adjacent to the propellers were moved to other seats away from the possible arc of any debris in case the propellers should contact the runway. Following this, the commander briefed the passengers on the problem and his intentions using the PA system. The cabin crew played the pre-recorded passenger emergency briefing and then walked through the cabin ensuring the passengers were all aware of what was required and that their restraint harnesses were secure. The passengers at the rear of the aircraft were warned of a possible increased drop to the ground from the rear doors due to the nose-down attitude if the NLG was not lowered. At Belfast International Airport, runway 25 was in use, the surface wind was 250° at 12 kt, visibility more than 10 km, clouds few at 1,800 feet and scattered at 2,900 feet, temperature +12°C, dew point +3°C, and the QNH 1020 hPa. The crew briefed for a radar vectored ILS approach for runway 25 with full landing flap and an approach speed of 110 kt. They also reviewed the emergency landing actions and reminded themselves where the CVR/FDR circuit breakers were located in order to ensure they were pulled after landing. The aircraft left the hold at 1320 hrs with 1,100 kg of fuel as planned and commenced the approach. All the normal checks were carried out and at about 4 nm, ATC informed them that the nose landing gear had not extended. The approach was continued as briefed and at 200 ft, the co-pilot gave the BRACE command over the PA and all the passengers were seen to adopt this position. The aircraft touched down at 1332 hrs on the main wheels and the nose was held off as the speed decayed and gently lowered onto the runway. As the aircraft came to a stop, both engines were shut down and when stopped, the commander ordered the evacuation.ConclusionThe investigation concluded that mechanical damage within the electrical harness of the primary nose gear lock proximity sensor caused an intermittent and erroneous sensor state change during landing gear retraction. The measured inductance value associated with the sensor state change was not sufficiently high for the sensor to be flagged as faulted, and the erroneous state change was therefore considered valid. This had the effect of interrupting the NLG retraction sequence by causing the forward NLG doors to close prematurely while the NLG was still retracting, such that the tyres came into contact with the doors. When the NLG finally retracted, the tyres became jammed in the NLG bay, preventing it from extending when subsequently commanded. The flight crew followed the appropriate procedures for dealing with the incident, which led to the safe landing and evacuation.Prior to this accident, the failure mode of an erroneous sensor state change below the threshold at which the sensor would declare itself faulted, had not previously been identified.  The investigation determined that the harness had been secured by a non-flexible cable tie, which restricted it from flexing during normal operation of the nose landing gear. This created loading cycles sufficient to create a cyclically-driven fatigue failure mechanism in the two conductor wires within the harness.The aircraft manufacturer has taken action to clarify nose landing gear proximity harness routing and attachment instructions in relevant AMM tasks, and has published inspection requirements. The aircraft and landing gear manufacturers are working to identify a more flexible harness design.10-11-201710-11-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2017

The aircraft, a Boeing 747-400F, was cleared for departure from runway 21 for a flight to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Shortly after initiating the takeoff roll, the aircraft swerved to the right. The flight crew was not able to regain directional control and the aircraft ran onto the grass where it was brought to a stop. Runway 21 has a Takeoff Distance Available (TODA) of 2500 meters.ConclusionThe runway excursion was caused by the pilots inability to maintain directional control under the conditions of prolonged asymmetric thrust that resulted from the loss of thrust on engine #4 at low speed. The loss of engine thrust was caused by a compressor stall.Contributing factorsThe thrust levers were not retarded immediately after the loss of thrust. Such delays and not following trained procedures have been associated with the phenomenon known as the startle effect.During training courses in flight simulators, the lessons learned from unexpected situations, such as engine failures, are quite limited as the crews know what to expect.11-11-2017",Cargo,Dutch Safety Board ,2017

Two crew members and four passengers suffered fatal injuries. A young girl was the only survivor. There was no fire.The aircraft operated on a domestic flight from Khabarovsk to Nikolayevsk-na-Amure and Nelkan. However, due to runway works at Nikolayevsk-na-Amure, it was decided to stop at Chumikan instead.At 1235 the crew radioed the Nelkan Tower controller and received the approach and landing conditions and the landing site actual weather. The approach to landing was conducted to runway 04 with the standalone NDB using the right-hand landing pattern.The approach was conducted with flaps at 18° and the landing gear in the down position. After the crew started to perform the final approach, they reported the readiness for landing and received the respective clearance from the controller. The PIC acted as Pilot Flying. In the course of the final approach, at distance of about 5 km and at height of 400 m, the autopilot was disengaged, and the PIC having the runway in sight decided to continue the landing.After the autopilot disengagement, both Power Control Levers (PCLs) were set to the fine pitch mode; then the crew performed the landing checklist. The final approach was conducted within the speed range of 100 to 115 KIAS. The crew then set the PCLs to the fine pitch mode.The abnormal situation started to develop at 131038 at height of approximately 170 m, when the speed was 108 kts. With the pedals' position remained unchanged and with zero roll, the magnetic heading was changed by 10° (to the right) within 5 seconds, then at 131044 when both thrust control levers (TCLs) were set to forward thrust, the no.2 engine entered the BETA RANGE. A right roll started to develop, and after 4 to 5 s it reached about 20-25°. The crew tried to arrest the roll, but the aircraft began to descend and quickly lost speed.The crew's control actions aimed to recover the aircraft by applying the TCL of the no.1 engine, as well as the controls for the ailerons, elevators and rudder, failed. The crew did not feather the no.2 propeller and the no.2 engine continued to operate.At 131053 at the height of 100 m, with a speed of 76 kts, the stall warning sounded. The aircraft started to develop an aggressive right roll and performed a full-circle rotation around its longitudinal axis (barrel-roll).The aircraft then impacted terrain.The investigation revealed that the no.2 engine propeller blades uncommanded turned to an angle of -1.8°, which was significantly below the minimum inflight pitch angle of 13.5°. During certification of the Let L-410 aircraft, the probability of a propeller uncommanded setting into the BETA range was considered to be 10-14.ConclusionThe direct cause of the L410UVP-E20 RA-67047 A/C accident was the uncommanded inflight RH engine propeller blades setting to the angle of minus 1.8° which is significantly below the minimum inflight pitch angle (13.5°) with TCLs set to forward thrust. It caused the significant rolling and turning moments, the A/C loss of speed and controllability, and the subsequent with the ground collision.The propeller blades' setting to the negative angles was caused by the failures of two systems the BETA Feedback system and the Pitch Lock system. As the Propeller Pitch Lock system components that are to be tested during the PITCH LOCK TEST most probably did not contribute to the system malfunction, then it is unlikely that the crews' deviation of the PITCH LOCK TEST procedure could have make any difference in the detection of the said system malfunction before the flight.The said situation had been classified as extremely improbable during the aircraft type certification, so, there was no required crew actions in AFM for such situations, and the respective crew training was not required.15-11-201715-11-201715-11-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2017

The last stop was Dhoores Water Aerodrome. The landing at Dhoores was carried out crosswind, parallel to the swell patterns.The aircraft cast off from the floating platform and 12 the captain gave control to the first officer to taxi the aircraft as he was the nominated Pilot Flying for the sector. According to the flight crew, as the sea conditions were bad, both pilots discussed the best path for the take-off and chose the best possible direction taking the swell patterns into consideration. This path was chosen because the swell effect is usually less prominent nearer to the island. On take-off run the aircraft struck a swell which felt like a small bump, the first officer continued the take-off run and struck the second swell on the right float. On striking the second swell the crew felt that the right float got detached. The aircraft bounced again and came down on the third swell, partially detaching the left float as well. The pilots tried to adjust the speed on every bounce by lowering the nose primarily to ride the swells and avoid heavy impact on the next swell.

The flight was a regular operated commercial passenger flight with scheduled stops in Dangriga, Placencia and with the final destination being Punta Gorda. The pilot reported that the portion of the flight from Belize City to Dangriga was uneventful and normal and so was the landing at Placencia.At approximately 0840 the airplane taxied from the Tropic Air ramp towards the west on runway 25. The pilot did a turnaround using all the available runway at normal speed and started his takeoff run to the east on runway 07. The pilot proceeded down the runway in a normal takeoff roll with normal takeoff speed and prior to reaching the end of the runway, he rotated the aircraft and lifted the nose wheel to get airborne. At exactly 28 feet past the end of runway 07 and during the initial climb phase, a part of the aircraft landing gear made contact with the upper part of the front righthand passenger door frame of a Subaru Forester car that had breached the area in front of the runway which is normally protected by traffic barriers. The impact caused the aircraft to deviate from its initial climb profile, and the pilot reported that the engine was working for a couple seconds and it abruptly shut down shortly after. The pilot realized that he was unable to return to the airport.The pilot carried out emergency drills for engine loss after take-off over water and decided to ditch the aircraft in the sea, which was approximately 200-300 feet from the main shoreline in front of the Placencia Airport. The flight crew and all passengers were safely evacuated from the fuselage with the assistance of witnesses and passing boats which provided an impromptu rescue for the passengers. All passengers received only minor injuries.On board at the time of the accident were Acting Prime Minister Patrick Faber and Immigration Minister Godwin Hulse, who were on their way to the official launch of the PG Multipurpose Complex.The runway at Placencia has a length of about 620 meters. Plancencia Road runs around the eastern runway end. Warning signs say vehicles must stop and give way to aircraft landing and taking off.CONCLUSION This accident is the result of an accumulation of failures in the areas of road traffic management and operator standard operating procedures, and a lack of implementation of aviation industry best practices.CONTRIBUTING FACTORS a. There is a lack of traffic surveillance to ensure that drivers comply with the warning signs of low flying aircraft and do not breach the barriers when they are down or inoperative. The left barrier at Placencia was reportedly inoperative and the right barrier was said to be working. As a result, this removed a significant level of protection for vehicles which operate on the portion of the road which intersects the departure path of aircraft. The purpose of the barriers is to protect vehicles from coming in close contact with low flying aircraft. The driver of the vehicle failed to adhere to traffic warning signs regarding low flying aircraft and drove his vehicle directly into the departure path of an aircraft (Probable cause).b. ADAS data calculations showed that the pilot had a period of 13.33 seconds when he achieved take off performance, but he did not rotate the aircraft. Although the aircraft engine performance was normal, the actual take-off weight was within limits and the distance available to the pilot to abort the take-off was 872 feet; the pilot still flew the aircraft at a dangerously low altitude over the road and did not properly assess the risk at hand which was a vehicle advancing into the aircrafts departure path which could cause a collision. (Probable cause).c. The angle at which the aircraft made contact with the vehicle was not a direct head on angle, but the contact was made when the vehicle was off to the right-hand side of the extended centerline of runway 07. The aircraft did not follow the direct path of the extended center line of runway 07 prior to making contact, but instead it made a slight right turn shortly after the wheels left the ground.

On board the aircraft was the captain, first officer, a check captain, two cabin crew and 67 passengers.The first officer was pilot flying, and the captain was pilot monitoring. The check captain was positioned in the observer seat on the flight deck and was conducting an annual line check of the captain along with a six month line check of the first officer over four flights on the day. The occurrence flight was the last of these flights.At about 1320 local time the flight crew were conducting a visual approach to runway 35 at Canberra. The calculated approach speed was 113 kt. At 132052, nine seconds prior to touch down, the aircraft approached the runway at a height of about 107 ft, slightly above the desired approach path. The flight crew reported that at about this time, there was turbulence and changing wind conditions. Flight data showed that at this time, speed had increased to 127 kt. In response to the increasing speed, the first officer reduced power to near flight idle.Over the next five seconds, the descent rate increased significantly and the speed reduced.During the last 50 ft of descent, the captain twice called for an increase in power and then called for a go-around. The first officer responded by increasing the power at about the same time as the aircraft touched down.At 132101, the aircraft touched down heavily on the main landing gear and rear fuselage with a peak recorded vertical acceleration of 2.97G. Assessing that the aircraft was under control, the captain immediately called to the first officer to cancel the go-around and then took control of the aircraft. The flight crew completed the landing roll and taxied to the gate without further incident.After shutting down the engines, the flight crew reviewed the recorded landing data which indicated a hard landing had occurred, requiring maintenance inspections. The captain then made an entry in the aircraft technical log, and subsequent inspections revealed that the aircraft had been substantially damaged. There were no reported injuries.Contributing factors- During the approach, the pilot flying did not identify that the speed had exceeded the stabilised approach criteria, which required immediate correction or initiation of a go-around.- In response to an assessment of overshoot shear, the pilot flying reduced power to idle at a height greater than that stipulated by operator procedures. This resulted in an abnormally high descent rate that was not reduced prior to touchdown.- A significant change in the wind direction and strength immediately before the aircraft touched down further increased the aircraft's descent rate and contributed to the resultant damage.- Verbal and physical intervention by the pilot monitoring did not prevent the hard landing.19-11-2017",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,ATSB ,2017

The flight was conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR) by day and the approach was conducted under visual flight rules (VFR). The captain was the pilot flying (PF).While on descent for Rand Airport, the first officer requested reported in-bound for a full-stop landing. The last wind direction data for runway 29 was transmitted by ATC as 230°/11 knots and QNH 1021. The FO acknowledged the transmission and the crew elected to land on runway 11. The captain stated that the approach for landing was stable and that the touchdown was near the first taxiway exit point. According to the FO, the aircraft floated for a while before touchdown. This was confirmed during the investigation. During the landing rollout, the captain applied the brakes and the brakes responded for a short while, however, the aircraft continued to roll without slowing down. At approximately 300 metres beyond the intersection of runway 35 and runway 11, the PIC requested the FO to apply emergency brakes. The FO applied the emergency brakes gradually and the aircraft continued to roll before the brakes locked and the tyres burst. The aircraft skidded on the main wheels and continued for approximately 180 m until it overshot the runway. The undercarriage went over a ditch of approximately 200 millimetres in depth at the end of the runway into the soft ground and the aircraft came to a stop approximately 10m from the threshold facing slightly left off the extended centre line runway 11.

As icing conditions were prevailing at Moscow airport, the crew set the selector of the ice protection control panel to ALL before starting up the engines. During their start-up, the A-I WINGSTAB FAIL message appeared on the EICAS. The crew tried to reinitialize the system by pressing the WINGSTAB pushbutton and then using the ICE PROT MODE selector. The failure message continued to be displayed. Around five minutes after take-off, the STALL PROT ANTICIPATE warning message appeared on the EICAS and remained on the screen until the end of the flight.The captain was PF and the first-officer PM for the arrival at Le Bourget airport.The METARs did not indicate icing conditions. The crew performed the ILS 27 approach at a speed of between 120 and 130 kt. At an altitude of 2,200 ft, while the aeroplane was on the ILS glide path, the AOA limiter protection activated itself and the autopilot (AP) automatically disengaged. The aeroplane passed under the glide slope and a glide slope warning sounded. The captain then increased thrust and levelled off in order to return to the approach path. The AOA limiter protection deactivated itself and the crew re-engaged the AP. At around 1,000 ft QNH, the AOA limiter protection activated itself again and the AP disengaged. The first officer told the captain to keep the speed above the red tape corresponding to the minimum speed authorized by the protection. This protection limits the angle of attack and did not allow the captain to sufficiently increase the aeroplanes pitch attitude in order to flare, despite making a full nose-up deflection on the sidestick.The aeroplane touched down on runway 27 with a rate of descent of around 1,350 ft/min and a load factor of 4 g. The right main landing gear ruptured and the upper rear hinge made a hole in the upper surface of the wing.ConclusionThe crew undertook the flight to Le Bourget airport despite the presence of the A-I WINGSTAB FAIL message and icing conditions at departure from Moscow. The occurrence of the failure is linked to the activation of the ice protection system in the ALL position before engine start-up. The procedure associated with this failure, as written at the time of the accident, did not enable the crew to reinitialize the ice protection system. The BEFORE TAKEOFF procedure and then the consultation of the MEL should have resulted in the crew postponing the flight.During the climb, the appearance of the STALL PROT ANTICIPATE message on the EICAS informed the crew of the increase in AOA limiter protection activation speeds. The associated procedure should have led the crew to increase the reference speed by 30 kt during the approach.27-11-2017",Private,BEA ,2017

The aircraft was destroyed. Six passengers and one crew member sustained serious injuries. Eighteen other aircraft occupants were also injured. One of the passengers, a 19-year old male, died of his injuries on December 25.The aircraft arrived at Fond-du-Lac Airport at 1725 local time. During the descent, the aircraft encountered icing conditions and the anti-icing and de-icing systems were activated. When the de-icing and anti-icing systems were turned off, residual ice remained on portions of the aircraft.At Fond-du-Lac Airport new passengers boarded and cargo was loaded on the aircraft.The operator, West Wind Aviation, had some de-icing equipment in the terminal building at the airport, consisting of two ladders, a hand-held spray bottle with electric blanket and wand, and a container of de-icing fluid. However, the aircraft was not de-iced before takeoff, and the takeoff was commenced with ice contamination on the aircraft.The aircraft took off from runway 28 at 1811, bound for Stony Rapids.At 1812, shortly after takeoff, the aircraft collided with trees and terrain less than a mile west of the end of runway 28. The wreckage path through trees and across terrain was at least 800 feet long. The aircraft came to rest with the forward cabin and cockpit rotated 90° to the right, and the remainder of the fuselage rotated about 35° to the right.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. When West Wind commenced operations into Fond-du-Lac Airport (CZFD) in 2014, no effective risk controls were in place to mitigate the potential hazard of ground icing at CZFD.2. Although both the flight crew and the dispatcher were aware of the forecast ground icing, the decision was made to continue with the days planned route to several remote airports that had insufficient de-icing facilities.3. Although the aircrafts ice-protection systems were activated on the approach to CZFD, the aircrafts de-icing boots were not designed to shed all of the ice that can accumulate, and the anti-icing systems did not prevent ice accumulation on unprotected surfaces. As a result, some residual ice began to accumulate on the aircraft.4. Although the flight crew were aware of the ice, there were no handling anomalies noted on the approach. Consequently, the crew likely did not assess that the residual ice was severe enough to have a significant effect on aircraft performance. Subsequently, without any further discussion about the icing, the crew continued the approach and landed at CZFD.5. Weather conditions on the ground were conducive to ice or frost formation, and this, combined with the nucleation sites provided by the residual mixed ice on the aircraft, resulted in the formation of additional ice or frost on the aircrafts critical surfaces.6. Because the available inspection equipment was inadequate, the first officers ice inspection consisted only of walking around the aircraft on a dimly lit apron, without a flashlight, and looking at the left wing from the top of the stairs at the left rear entry door (L2). As a result, the full extent of the residual ice and ongoing accretion was unknown to the flight crew.7. Departing from remote airports, such as CZFD, with some amount of surface contamination on the aircrafts critical surfaces, had become common practice, in part due to the inadequacy of de-icing equipment or services at these locations. The past success of these adaptations resulted in the unsafe practice becoming normalized and this normalization influenced the flight crews decision to depart.8. Although the flight crew were aware of icing on the aircrafts critical surfaces, they decided that the occurrence departure could be accomplished safely. Their decision to continue with the original plan to depart was influenced by continuation bias, as they perceived the initial and sustained cues that supported their plan as more compelling than the later cues that suggested another course of action.9. As a result of the ice that remained on the aircraft following the approach and the additional ice that had accreted during the ground stop, the aircrafts drag was increased by 58% and its lift was decreased by 25% during the takeoff.10. During the takeoff, despite the degraded performance, the aircraft initially climbed; however, immediately after lift off, the aircraft began to roll to the left without any pilot input. This roll was as a result of asymmetric lift distribution due to uneven ice contamination on the aircraft.11. Following the uncommanded roll, the captain reacted as if the aircraft was an uncontaminated ATR 42, with the expectation of normal handling qualities and dynamic response characteristics; however, due to the contamination, the aircraft had diminished roll damping resulting in unexpected handling qualities and dynamic response.12. Although the investigation determined the ailerons had sufficient roll control authority to counteract the asymmetric lift, due to the unexpected handling qualities and dynamic response, the roll disturbance developed into an oscillation with growing magnitude and control in the roll axis was lost.13. This loss of control in the roll axis, which corresponds with the known risks associated with taking off with ice contamination, ultimately led to the aircraft colliding with terrain.14. The aircraft collided with the ground in relatively level pitch, with a bank angle of 30° left. As a result of the sudden vertical deceleration upon contact with the ground, the aircraft suffered significant damage, which varied in severity at different locations on the aircraft because of the impact angle and the variability in structural design.15. The design standards for transport category aircraft in effect at the time the ATR 42 was certified did not specify minimum loads that a fuselage structure must be able to tolerate and remain survivable, or minimum loads for fuselage impact energy absorption. As a result, the ATR 42 was not designed with these crashworthy principles in mind.16. On impact, the induced acceleration was not attenuated because the landing gear housing did not deform. This unattenuated acceleration resulted in a large inertial load from the wing, causing the wing support structure to fail and the wing to collapse into the cabin.17. The reduced survivable space between the floor above the main landing gear and the collapsed upper fuselage caused crushing injuries, such as major head, body, and leg trauma, to passengers in the middle-forward left section of the aircraft. Of the 3 passengers in this area, 2 experienced serious life-changing injuries, and 1 passenger died.18. The collapse of part of the floor structure compromised the restraint systems, limiting the protection afforded to the occupants when they were experiencing vertical, longitudinal, and lateral forces. This resulted in serious velocity-related injuries and impeded their ability to take post-impact survival actions in a timely manner.19. Most passengers in this occurrence did not brace before impact. Because their torsos were unrestrained, they received injuries consistent with jackknifing and flailing, such as hitting the seat in front of them.20. Given that regulations requiring the use of child-restraint systems have yet to be implemented, the aircraft was not equipped with these devices. As a result, the infant passenger was unrestrained and received flail and crushing injuries.21. As a result of unapproved repairs, the flight attendant seat failed on impact, resulting in injuries that impeded her ability to perform evacuation and survival actions in a timely manner.13-12-201713-12-201713-12-201713-12-20178 March 1991F-WWEGATR14 May 1991XA-RUCAviación del Noroeste1995XA-RUCAviación del NoroesteDec 1996N240JSFocus Aviation9 March 19995Y-JNTEagle Aviation19 June 2001N240JSFocus Aviation15 Feb. 2002N240JSHurstfield Ltd26 July 2002ZS-OWUHurstfield LtdFeb. 20035Y-BRBAircraft Leasing Services (ALS)28 April 2004ZS-OVLExecutive Turbine Aviation15 May 2004ZS-OVLZambia AirwaysSep. 2004ZS-OVLExecutive Turbine AviationOct. 2004ZS-OVLAircraft Africa ContractsFeb. 2005ZS-OVLUnited Nations2 Jan. 20075Y-BUTFly54018 June 2010D2-FLAFly5401 June 2012C-GWEAWest Wind Aviation",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2017

At 1812 the flight was told to turn right to 150 degrees descend to 4000 feet. At 1813 Zurich Arrival radioed ""[...] right heading two one five, cleared for the ILS approach two four, report established.""This was confirmed by the crew and read back correctly.Subsequently, the radar controller observed that the aircraft crossed the localizer slightly at 4000 feet at a speed of approximately 240 KIAS, and began a rapid descent. The crew did not respond to repeated calls.At 1814 the plane touched obstacles in a forest area directly west of Waldburg. It then flew at high speed, at a shallow angle, into another piece of forest about 1000 m away. The three occupants were fatally injured and the plane destroyed.A review of previous approaches to Friedrichshafen by OE-FWD showed that the localizer was intercepted at airspeeds between 220 and 240 knots. Every time the localizer was crossed after turning onto the final approach course.The investigation is continuing.ConclusionsThe aircraft accident was caused by a sudden loss of control of the aircraft in clouds while turning in for the approach to Friedrichshafen at night.Probably the frontal weather with light to moderate turbulence, snowfall and icing contributed to this.The absence of information about the events on board the aircraft meant that it was not possible to determine the causes of the loss of control.",Executive,BFU Germany ,2017

On touchdown they noticed that the aircraft de-rotated sharply. The pilot flying (PF) was unable to maintain directional control during the landing roll and the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway onto the grass. At some point during the landing the throttles were moved forward, reducing the rate of deceleration. As the aircraft left the paved surface the crew realised that the landing had been carried out with the Emergency/Parking brake set. The aircraft may have remained on the runway surface but for the addition of forward thrust during the landing roll.ConclusionThe accident arose as a result of the inadvertent selection of the Emergency/Parking brake instead of the speed brake. The levers are of similar shape and sited close to each other but with a different appearance and mode of action. There is also a brake on indicator light. These risk controls proved ineffective in preventing the inadvertent selection of the Emergency/parking brake both on this occasion and on at least two previous occasions.Once the parking brake had been set there were opportunities to detect and correct the error, but a busy flight deck environment together with a high workload contributed to it going unnoticed.After touchdown, the aircraft may have remained on the runway surface but for the addition of forward thrust during the landing roll.The manufacturer stated that it did not intend to conduct a system review relating to the parking brake status.22-12-2017",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2017

The pilot elected to track across the Sarawaget ranges, from Derim to Nadzab Airport, not above 10,000 ft. GPS recorded track data immediately prior to the last GPS fix showed that the aircraft was on a shallow descent towards the ridge at that time. The aircraft impacted the ridge about 150 metres beyond the last fix.During the search for the aircraft, what appeared to be the right aileron was found hanging from a tree near the top of the heavily-timbered, densely-vegetated ridge. The remainder of the wreckage was found about 150 m from the aileron along the projected track. The aircraft impacted the ground in a steep nose-down, right wing-low attitude. The majority of the aircraft wreckage was contained at the ground impact point. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. The pilot, the sole occupant, initially survived. The pilot had made contact with one of the operators pilots at 1615 on 23 December. Bad weather in the area prevented a recovery until December 26. By that time the pilot had died of his injuries.Causes [Contributing factors]Cloud build up along the pilot's chosen route may have forced him to manoeuvre closer than normal to the ridge, in order to avoid flying into the cloud.The aircraft's right wing struck a tree protruding from the forest canopy during controlled flight into terrain. It is likely that the right aileron mass balance became snagged on the tree and rapidly dislodged the aileron from the wing. The loss of roll control, and the aerodynamic differential, forced the aircraft to descend steeply through the forest and impacted terrain.Other factorWhile not contributing to this accident, the lack of appropriate and effective Search and Rescue capability, and the lack of a Rescue Coordination Centre established, maintained and operated in accordance with ICAO Annex 12 Standards, likely contributed to the delayed rescue.23-12-2017",Cargo,AIC PNG ,2017

At the time of the accident, there was no one on board and the aircraft was not being tended to. It had been parked with a heading of 9.5°.  At the time of the accident, the wind was blowing from the left rear quarter of the aircraft that tended to propel the aircraft forward and rotate it anticlockwise in the direction of the wind, due to the natural weather-cocking effect caused by the fin. This effect became sufficiently strong to castor the nose wheel and deflect it anticlockwise.The aircraft rotated to the left on its outer tyre on the port undercarriage, with the two nose wheel tyres narrowly missing their chocks. The rotation continued up to a point where the angle between the tyre and chock became acute enough to dislodge the front chock of the left Main-Gear, a movement that left the aircraft completely free.At the time of the accident it was dark with patches of rain; the surface wind on runway 05, which is close to Park 4, was reported to be ranging between 220°230°, gusting to 35 kts.The strong localised wind is what moved the aircraft from its parking position, but unintentional errors and oversights may have been contributory factors.

All 12 occupants suffered fatal injuries.The accident airplane was the second of a flight of two airplanes transporting hotel guests from Punta Islita to San José, where most of the passengers had international airline flights out of Costa Rica. Both airplanes were Cessna 208B airplanes. The first airplane departed Punta Islita using runway 3 and after liftoff made a right turn through a pass through the hills that led back out to the ocean. The first airplane reached San José successfully. The accident airplane remained on the ground for about 15 minutes longer. According to the hotel worker that was at the airport during the departure, when the accident airplane took off, it did not make the same right turn as the prior airplane but continued on runway heading. The terrain in the direction of the runway orientation consisted of a valley with rising terrain on either side. The valley continues and turns left with the floor of the valley rising until reaching a mountain. When heading in a northerly direction there was no exit from the valley. The airplane impacted terrain on the northwest side of the valley about 0.5 miles from the departure end of runway 3 at Punta Islita.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The flight crew's failure to maintain airspeed while maneuvering to exit an area of rising terrain, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's decision to continue the takeoff toward rising terrain that likely exceeded the airplane's climb capability, the lack of adequate weather reporting available for wind determination, and the lack of documented training for an airport requiring a non-standard departure.""31-12-201731-12-201731-12-201731-12-201731-12-201731-12-201719 Nov. 2001N375WYNorth Platte Express Inc12 Dec. 2007N375WYGrand Canyon Airlines16 Jan. 2008N181GCGrand Canyon Airlines8 Dec. 2011TI-BEINature Air11 Feb. 2016N181GCGrand Canyon Airlines21 Nov. 2017TI-BEINature Air","AirRegistration TI-BEIMSN 208B0900First flight 2001Total airframe hrs12073Cycles20813Engines 1 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114ACrewFatalities 2 / Occupants 2PassengersFatalities 10 / Occupants 10TotalFatalities 12 / Occupants 12 Aircraft damage DestroyedAircraft fate Written off (damaged beyond repair)Location0,6 km (0.4 mls) N of Punta Islita Airport (PBP) (   Costa Rica) Phase Initial climb (ICL)NatureDomestic Non Scheduled Passenger",NTSB ,2017

The jet carried four passengers and a three-person crew. The aircraft was parked at the north end of the apron. Once the passengers had left, the flight crew put covers on the engines and external sensors.The next planned flight was a positioning flight on 4 January 2018, to Ekaterinburg, Russia, without passengers. The crew arrived at the airport to prepare for the flight at approximately 1500. Take-off, as per the flight plan, was to happen at 1700.The ground handling company transported them to the aircraft by bus at approximately 1520. The captain opened the door at which time the cabin assistant entered the cabin. The captain and the co-pilot placed their flight bags behind the cockpit and went back outside. The co-pilot placed the aircrew's baggage into the rear baggage compartment which opens from the outside. The captain and the co-pilot removed the engine covers which they had put in place on the day of their arrival. These were put into their own storage bags and also placed in the baggage compartment.Following this, the captain went into the cockpit and started the APU, which generates electricity for aircraft systems and bleed air for heating the cabin. The co-pilot began to brush off the snow that had fallen on the aircraft. A moment later the captain came out to help the co-pilot. At first, he worked with his bare hands. Due to the extremely cold conditions (-22°C), however, he went back inside to fetch a pair of gloves. When he came back out, he closed the door.A little later the cabin assistant inside the cabin felt strange pressure in her ears and chest.She went into the cockpit and attempted to get the attention of the pilots working outside by knocking on the window. The pilots noticed the knocking and the captain went to open the door. According to the co-pilots observations it was unusually difficult for the captain to get the door open. Then, the captain pulled harder on the door handle at which time the door blew open with excessive force, hitting the captain who was standing underneath the door and knocking him to the ground. The pressure wave also knocked the co-pilot down, who had been standing approximately one metre from the left side of the door.The co-pilot stood up and saw the captain lying on his back on the ground. Realising that the captain was unconscious, the co-pilot turned him on his side. Then he entered the cabin and saw the cabin assistant in a semi-seated position on the floor of the cabin. The co-pilot shook the assistants shoulder and advised her to go outside. The captain died as a result of the serious injuries he sustained at the site of the occurrence. The co-pilot had not sustained any physical injuries. The cabin assistant had bruises on her right arm, continued to feel chest pain and was diagnosed with a mild concussion. The cabin sustained substantial damage. The cockpits aft left bulkhead and the cabins forward left bulkhead were nearly torn off.CONCLUSIONS1. When the aircraft is parked outside for a longer period, some pilots may close the outflow valve to prevent the ingestion of contaminants into the valve, or upstream into the cabin.2. When the APU is being run one must check that the outflow valve is fully open. If it is not possible to ensure that the valve is open or to remove differential pressure by other means, the door must not be closed.3. The door had no indication warning of excessive cabin pressure, nor an opening for depressurisation. The cabin was pressurised because the APU bleed air was ducted into the cabin, the outflow valve was closed and the door was also closed. Significant differential pressure existed between the cabin and the outside.4. Cabin pressurisation on the ground also creates a hazard for several other groups of professionals, such as aircraft mechanics, ground handling staff, aircraft cargo loaders and rescue personnel.04-01-2018",Ferry/positioning,AIB Finland ,2018

Initially a Beech 1900 had been scheduled for this flight, but the airline decided to use C6-MIC, an EMB-110 Bandeirante, instead.  A revised flight plan was not submitted to ATC.Weather at the destination, Governor's Harbour Airport, was poor due to heavy rainfall. The pilot in command of the aircraft initially attempted a landing on runway 15 at Governor's Harbour Airport but executed a go-around when visual contact was lost due to heavy rain. On the second attempt for landing, a decision was made to switch to runway 33 and while on final approach to runway 33, visual contact was lost again and a second go-around was executed. On the third attempt the pilot landed on runway 33, but seconds after touchdown there was a collapse of the left main landing gear which subsequently led to a runway excursion taking place.Investigators noticed that the landing gear selector switch was located in the ""UP"" position. Consultation with the operator's maintenance personnel and the aircraft manufacturer has determined, based on the systems operation, that if the landing gear switch is placed in the ""UP"" position and the gear contact micro-switch on either landing gear is contaminated with dirt, water or other contaminants, or if the switch is shorted out for whatever reason, it is possible that the gear may not retract when commanded by the selection of the gear switch. In this instance, it is possible that the gear position lights may still indicate ""3-green lights"" (which normally indicates the gear as being ""down and locked"") despite the gear selector handle being selected to the ""UP"" position. However, once you land or the contaminant is removed or the ""system short"" is corrected, or no longer exists, there is a possibility that the gear could collapse (if the gear selector switch is in the ""UP"" position, as was the case). The AAID believes this to be the case, as no mechanical irregularities have been found or could be replicated that would otherwise explain why the gear collapsed. The AAID also investigated the licensing and record keeping regarding the flight crew. It appeared that the captain of the flight initially had a US FAA license. During his stay in the US, he was convicted and incarcerated for controlled substance violations. As a consequence his FAA commercial pilot license was revoked for life on 11 August 2009.After returning to the Bahamas, he applied for an Airman License Validation based on a (revoked!) Foreign License in June 2011. It is unclear if he received this validation at that time.He was issued a commercial pilot license in May 2013, which was renewed in 2015 and valid until August 2020. The AAID found that no duty time, flight time or sectors were recorded for the captain between a proficiency check was completed on March 2013 and January 9, 2018 (date of the accident). It also appeared that the Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport refused to issue an ID badge to the captain for unescorted access to the restricted airside, citing his US criminal record. Nevertheless he subsequently obtained an ID badge issued by the Grand Bahama Airport Company in Freeport, Grand Bahama. This was not valid for Nassau Airport, yet he managed to gain airside at Nassau without any problems.The AAID attributes this accident to ""pilot error."" The poor decision making exercised by the crew in attempting several landings in severe weather has been determined as the probable cause of the accident.Also contributing to this accident was the actions of the crew where, after 2 failed landing attempts and executing 2 go around maneuvers, they failed to realize the landing gear selector handle was selected in the ""UP"" position when the aircraft was configured for the 3rd landing. The situation was further exacerbated by additional human factor errors such as operating under periods of high stress, departing after such long delays, operating in severe weather, and flying at night- all factors experienced by the crew, which are contributory in this accident.Crew training, qualification, and authorization has been investigated and found questionable and also may have contributed to the accident.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAID Bahamas ,2018

All 65 passengers and 6 crew members were killed.The aircraft took off from runway 14R at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport at 1421 hours local time (1121 UTC). Weather about the time of departure at Domodedovo Airport included limited visibility (2100m) during light snowfall. Temperature was -5°C, overcast cloud deck at 2600 feet AGL.The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that, prior to departure, the heating of the three pitot tubes had not been turned on. After takeoff, at an altitude of 130-150 m (425-490 ft) above ground level, the autopilot was switched on. Flaps were raised as the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 550 m (1800 feet).About 2 minutes 30 seconds after the takeoff, at an altitude of about 1300 meters (4265 feet) and an instrument speed of 465-470 km/h, there were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The airspeed on the copilot's side is unknown as this parameter was not registered by the flight data recorder. There were no significant difference in the altitude indications. After another 25 seconds, the discrepancies reached about 30 km/h with the speed on the captain's side being greater.After about 50 seconds, at an altitude of about 2000 meters (6560 ft), the airspeed on the standby airspeed indicator was higher and continued to increase while the airspeed on the captains ASI continued to decrease.The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot. The airspeed on the captain's side continued to decrease, while the standby ASI showed 540-560 km/h. About 50 seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the flight passed an altitude of 1700-1900 m (5580-6230 ft) with vertical loads ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 g. Subsequently the aircraft entered a steep descent with the ASI on the captain's side showing 0 km/h, and the standby ASI showing 200 km/h. The pitch angle decreased to -30/-35 degrees with a vertical load factor of  0 g.The aircraft impacted a snowy field around 142705 and disintegrated. Before the collision with the ground, the standby ASI had increased to 800 km/h with the captain's ASI still displaying 0 km/h.The captain of the An-148 had 2168 hours on type, of which 58 as captain. The first officer had 672 hours on type.The AN-148-100V RA-61704 crash occurred due to erroneous actions of the crew at the stage of climbing in instrument weather conditions at unreliable readings of instrument speed caused by icing (blockage of ice) of all three pitot tubes, which led to the loss of control over the parameters of the aircraft, its transfer to dive and collision with the ground. The accident was classified as a loss of control in flight (LOC-I).The investigation revealed systemic weaknesses in the identification of hazards and risk control, the inoperability of the airline's flight safety management system and the lack of control over the level of training of crew members by aviation authorities at all levels, which led to the issuance of certificates of aviation personnel and the admission to the flights of the crew, which did not fully meet the qualification requirements.The most likely contributing factors were- Hurry of the crew in preparation for the flight due to the late arrival of the aircraft from the previous flight and attempts to ""catch up"" with the time;- Skipping by the crew of the operation to switch on the pitot tube heating before takeoff and failing to comply with the section of the check list ""BEFORE TAKE-OFF"", which provides for the control of this action;- design features of the An-148 aircraft in terms of the restrictions on the duration of pitot tube heating operation on the ground, which led to the need to carry out operations to control the inclusion of pitot tube heating and compliance with the principle of ""dark cockpit"" in a separate section of the ""BEFORE THE FLIGHT"" check list, which is performed immediately before the start of the takeoff run, which creates additional risks of missing these operations. These actions are provided in the section ""ON THE RUNWAY START"";- systematic failure of the airline's crews to comply with the ""dark cockpit"" principle and the requirements of the radar, which contributed to ""getting used"" to the takeoff with the presence of emergency and warning messages on the Integrated system and alarm indicator (KISS) and did not allow to identify the fact that the pitot tube heating was not included. In the accident flight before takeoff, six warning messages were displayed on the KISS, including three messages about the absence of pitot tube heating;- design features of the An-148 aircraft, connected with the impossibility to disable the display of a number of warning messages on the KISS even when performing the whole range of works provided for by the MMEL while ensuring the flight with delayed defects;- low safety culture in the airline, which was manifested in systematic failure to record in the flight log the failures detected during the flight, as well as in the performance of flights with the failures not eliminated and/or not included in the list of delayed failures, accompanied by the corresponding messages on the KISS;- Failure to take necessary measures in case of detection of previous facts of untimely activation of pitot tube heating by crews based on the results of express analysis of flight information;- Unreadiness of the crew to take actions in case of triggering the alarm ""Speed of Emergency"" due to the lack of appropriate theoretical training in the airline and the impossibility to work out this special situation on the flight simulation device and / or during airfield training and, as a consequence, failure to comply with the procedures provided for after triggering of this alarm;- Absence of federal aviation regulations for certification of flight simulators, the development of which is provided for by the Air Code of the Russian Federation;- Approval for the existing AN-148 flight simulators of the IFC Training LLC and the CTC of the Saint-Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation without taking into account their actual capabilities to reproduce special flight cases, as well as the provisions of FAR-128;- Absence of specific values of flight parameters (engine operation mode, pitch and roll angles, etc.) in the aircraft's flight manual, which must be maintained by the crew of the airspeed alarm system, as well as absence of the situation with unreliable instrument speed readings (Unreliable Airspeed Procedure) in the list of special flight cases;- Increased psycho-emotional tension of crew members at the final stage of the flight due to inability to understand the causes of speed fluctuations and, as a consequence, the captain falling under the influence of the ""tunnel effect"" with the formation of the dominating factor of speed control according to the ""own"" (left) airspeed indicator without a comprehensive assessment of flight parameters;- Insufficient training of pilots in the field of human factor, methods of threat and error control and management of crew resources;- individual psychological peculiarities of pilots (for the captain - reduction of intellectual and behavioral flexibility, fixation on their own position with the inability (impossibility) to ""hear"" prompts from the second pilot; for the second pilot - violation of the organization and sequence of actions), which in a stressful situation in the absence of proper level of management of the crew resources came to the fore; loss of the captain's psychological performance (psychological stupor, psychological incapacitation), which resulted in complete loss of spatial orientation and did not allow reacting to correct prompts and actions of the co-pilot, including when triggering the PULL UP warning of the EGPWS system;- Absence of psychological incapacitation criteria in the airline's AFM, which prevented the second pilot from taking more drastic measures;- High annual leave arrears for special conditions, which could lead to fatigue and negatively affect the performance of the captain;- Operation of the aircraft control system in the longitudinal channel in the reconfiguration mode with unreliable signals of instrument speed, not described in the operational documentation, related to a double increase in the transfer coefficient from the hand wheel to the steering wheel in the flight configuration and constant deviation of the steering wheel for diving (without deviation of the steering wheel) for about 60 seconds, which reduced the time required for the crew to recognize the situation.11-02-201811-02-2018May 2010RA-6170423 June 2010RA-61704Rossiya28 July 2013RA-61704Rossiya23 August 2013RA-61704Rossiya14 April 2015RA-61704Rossiya8 February 2017RA-61704Saratov Airlines",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2018

All on board (60 passengers, two flight crew members, two cabin crew members and two security officers) were killed.The flight departed Mehrabad Airport at 0805 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL210. At 0922 the aircraft was over the Isfahan (IFN) VOR. The flight requested permission to descend from FL210 to FL170. This was approved by Tehran ACC. The flight followed Airway W114 from the OBTUX navaid to the Yasuj DVOR/DME. Minimum altitude on that airway is FL170. Minimum safe altitude (MSA) over the sector close to Yasuj Airport is 15500 feet.Weather reported to the crew indicated a cloud ceiling of 15000 feet. Despite their clearance for FL170 and the MSA in the area, the crew subsequently selected FL150 as their target altitude. The flight levelled off at FL150 at 0928 hours and the de-ice & anti-ice systems were switched on. Subsequently the flight crew selected the autopilot's altitude mode to FL150. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave with vertical (updraft) winds reaching up to 3000 ft/min with associated icing conditions. Since the autopilot attempted to maintain FL150, engine power reduced to flight idle and the aircraft pitched down -4°. In these conditions the speed gradually reduced from a Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 205 knots.At 092944 the flight crew switched off the de-ice & anti-ice systems. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave downdraft. Engine powered increased and the nose pitched up because the autopilot was attempting to get back to FL150. The CAS meanwhile dropped to 130 knots.The pilot then selected FL140 on the autopilot as the airspeed dropped to 118 knots. The stall warning sounded and the autopilot disconnected automatically. Airspeed increased to 134 knots as the aircraft descended at a rate of -3200 ft/m. At 093122 the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot and set FL150 as their target altitude.Four seconds later the aircraft became close to the surrounding mountainous terrain and the EGPWS alarm sounded. Radio altitude at that point was 3643 feet (pressure altitude 13869 ft).The autopilot was disengaged again as the aircraft continued to lose altitude. Unable to regain altitude the flight crew noticed the mountain side ahead rolled the plane -86° to the left. The nose pitched up and the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 093141.The wreckage was located the following day in the snow, 350 feet below the top of a 13,412 ft high mountain.Probable causes (from final report)The main cause of accidentThe accident was happened due to many chains of considered causes but the 'Human Factor' had main role for the conclusion of the scenario. The Cockpit Crew action which has caused dangerous conditions for the flight is considered as main cause. Based on provided evidences, the errors of cockpit crew were as follows- Continuing to the Yasouj airport for landing against Operation manual of the Company, due to low altitude ceiling of the cloud and related cloud mass. They should divert to alternate airport.- Descending to unauthorized altitude below minimum of the route and MSA- Lack of enough CRM during flight- Failure to complete the stall recovery (flap setting, max RPM).- Inappropriate use of Autopilot after Stall condition- Inadequate anticipation for bad weather based on OM (Clouds, Turbulence, and Icing ...)- Quick action to switch off anti-ice system and AOA- Failure to follow the Check lists and standard call out by both pilotsContributing FactorsThe contributive factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following- the airline was not capable to detect systematic defectives about - effectiveness of crew training about Meteorology, OM, SOP, ...- enough operational supervision on pilot behaviors- The lack of SIGMET about Mountain Wave or Severe Mountain wave- Unclear procedure for stall recovery in FCOM- Lack of warning in aircraft manuals by manufacturer for flight crew awareness about mountain wave.- Lack of APM System to alert crew about performance degradation18-02-201818-02-201818-02-201826 Oct. 1993F-WWEDATR12 Dec. 1993EP-ATSIran Aseman Airlines2011EP-ATSIran Aseman AirlinesNov. 2017EP-ATSIran Aseman Airlines",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB Iran ,2018

The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM).Following an uneventful en route part of the flight, the aircraft was issued descent clearances to FL220 and then further down to FL80.During descent, the PF briefed for the localizer approach to runway 21.Port Harcourt Approach then reported the presence of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds along the approach path of runway 21, and requested flight 363 to report intentions. Dana 363 responded ""I will like to come closer then we take our decision I will advise"". Meanwhile, the Tower controller informed the Approach controller that the intensity of rain had increased to heavy rain.At 1843 Arik Air 766 peformed a go around on the approach to runway 03 due to windshear. At 1845, Dana 363 was cleared for the LOC approach to runway 21. Shortly afterwards the captain took over control after realizing the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) 2 was unserviceable.When the aircraft was 12 miles to touch down, the Approach controller instructed the flight to contact Tower. The crew was engaged in changing the frequencies on the navigation radio receivers since the VOR DME was not showing.An initial attempt by the PM to contact the Tower was not on the correct frequency, during which both Tower and Approach were trying to contact the aircraft. Approximately 1.5 minutes after the first attempt, contact with the Tower was established on the correct frequency.The captain then instructed the first officer to watch out for the runway. A few seconds after, the captain was heard yelling for wipers. After a while, the captain sighted the runway and instructed the first officer to report this to the Tower controller. Thirty-two seconds later, an aural warning ""Sink rate""! ""Sink rate""!! ""Sink rate""!!! ""Sink rate""!!!! came on.The aircraft descended through approach minimums (460 feet AGL), crossed the threshold and did a smooth touchdown on the runway at 7972 feet from the threshold in high winds of 360°/22 kt. The aircraft landed without obtaining landing clearance from the Tower controller.Landing Distance Available (LDA) for runway 21 was 9843 feet which left a remaining length of 1871 feet for the aircraft to stop.According to the captain, during landing roll, the brakes were applied while simultaneously deploying thrust reversers to maximum; all spoilers automatically deployed after the nose wheel touched the ground. The crew continued to apply brakes until maximum braking was commanded. The aircraft could not be stopped during brake application and the captain continued applying the brake pedals to maximum.The aircraft was on the centreline until it veered off left approximately 200 feet from the end of the runway, exited the paved surface and came to a stop 978 feet from the end of the runway After the aircraft came to a complete stop, engines were shut down and emergency power switch was turned ON. The emergency light came ON, all other lights were OFF and the Public Address System was not working, the lead crew had to open the cockpit door to obtain emergency evacuation instructions from the captain.Emergency evacuation was carried out using only the left forward main door and the escape slide on this door did not deploy. All persons on board were evacuated unhurt.Causal factorThe accident was caused by an underestimation of the degradation of weather conditions (heavy rain, visibility and strong wind on short final and landing) and the failure by the crew to initiate a missed approach which was not consistent with the companys SOP.Contributory FactorsOther contributing factors to this accident were- Non-compliance to companys SOP in meeting crew competency and complement requirements.- Ineffective two-way communication between the ATC and DAN0363 during final approach prevented the flow of technical information on runway surface condition and other relevant meteorological information essential to safety.- Failure of the crew to crosscheck the prevailing wind and also to obtain landing clearance from the ATC during final approach after contact with ATC was restored.20-02-201820-02-2018",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AIB Nigeria ,2018

Prior to the departure, the fuel tanks were filled to capacity and the pilot and passengers boarded the aircraft inside the operator's heated hangar. The aircraft was towed outside of the hangar without being treated with anti-ice fluid, and taxied for the departure on runway 07. Due to an inbound arrival at Abbotsford, C-GIAE was delayed for departure. Once cleared for takeoff, the aircraft had been exposed to snow and freezing conditions for approximately 13 minutes. Approximately 4 to 5 seconds after takeoff, the pilot selected the landing gear control to the up position. As the gear retracted, the aircraft rolled approximately 30° to the left. To correct the uncommanded left bank, the pilot applied right aileron, and the aircraft returned to a near wings-level attitude. In order to make an immediate off-field emergency landing, the pilot retarded the power levers and then applied forward pressure on the control column to land the aircraft. The aircraft struck terrain between runway 07 and taxiway C. The aircraft slid across the snow-covered ground for approximately 760 feet before coming to rest in a raspberry patch located on the airport property.Four passengers and the pilot sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident which destroyed the aircraft.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The occurrence aircraft exited a warm hangar and was exposed to 14 minutes of heavy snow in below-freezing conditions. This resulted in a condition highly conducive to severe ground icing.2. As the aircraft climbed out of ground effect on takeoff, it experienced an aerodynamic stall as a result of wing contamination.3. The pilot's decision making was affected by continuation bias, which resulted in the pilot attempting a takeoff with an aircraft contaminated with ice and snow adhering to its critical surfaces.4. The pilot and the passenger seated in the right-hand crew seat were not wearing the available shoulder harnesses. As a result, they sustained serious head injuries during the impact sequence.5. During the impact sequence, the cargo restraint system used to secure the baggage in the rear baggage compartment failed, causing some of the baggage to injure passengers seated in the rear of the aircraft cabin.23-02-201823-02-201823-02-2018",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2018

Four of the occupants received minor injuries.Findings as to causes and contributing factors- The captain continued the approach beyond the final approach fix when the reported visibility was below the approach ban minima.- During the approach, runway lighting was reduced to medium intensity, which was 30% of maximum strength, thereby reducing the probability of seeing the visual references required to conduct the landing on the runway.- The captain proceeded with the landing sequence, without seeing or knowing the length of the remaining runway ahead and unable to accurately assess the aircrafts position.- The aircraft landed approximately 3800 feet past the threshold, 700 feet from the end of the runway, and stopped its landing roll in a snowbank, 220 feet beyond the runway.- The deviation from standard operating procedures at a critical moment of flight was a source of confusion between the flight crew members, to the point where the aircraft was not configured for a landing, which increased the landing distance required.- The captain, focused on the landing manoeuvre and experiencing narrowed attention, was unable to make the decision to conduct a go-around. He lost the notion of time and flew over the runway for 20 seconds, not realizing that it was now impossible to touch down and come to a stop before the end of the runway.- Without policies, clear procedures and training, the first officer did not have the tools necessary to shift from a passive advisory role to proactive assertiveness strong enough to convince the captain to conduct a go-around.- The approach ban was ineffective in preventing this approach while visibility on the ground was below the minimum required for an approach ban.26-02-201826-02-2018",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2018
28-FEB-2018,Airbus A320-214,ES-SAN,SmartLynx Airlines Estonia,0,Tallinn-Lenn...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20180228-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Loss of control,"A SmartLynx Estonia Airbus A320-214 suffered a loss off control during a training flight at Tallinn Airport, Estonia.At 1203 hours local time the aircraft departed Tallinn as crew training flight MYX9001. Onboard were a captain-instructor as well as a second pilot, four students and a Civil Aviation Administration inspector. Numerous circuits and touch-and-goes were performed, including two full stop landings. During final approach to runway 08 at 1704, the aircraft stopped responding to flight control inputs. Altitude was lost and the aircraft hit the runway. The engines touched the runway and the main landing gear doors broke. The aircraft then managed to gain altitude and the pilots were able to stabilize the aircraft and turn back. Both engines, however, lost power after the turn back to the airport.An emergency landing was carried out at 1711, about 150 meters from the runway. The aircraft came to a halt in the snow 15 meters south of the runway.The flight crew members evacuated the aircraft via the L1 door emergency escape slides. A video of the incident shows what appears to be a tire rolling away from the aircraft as it came to a stop. Photos from the scene seem to show that one of the nose landing gear tires is missing. Photos also indicate that the ram air turbine (RAT) had been deployed.Causal factorsThis accident results from the combination of the following factors- The intermittent THSA override mechanism malfunction allowing to cause the loss of pitch control by both ELACs.The repetitive triggering of the ELAC PITCH faults was caused by the non or late activations of the PTA micro-switches, which were due to the OVM piston insufficient stroke. The insufficient OVM stroke was caused by the THSA OVM clutch unit non-standard friction. The oil in the THSA OVM casing appeared to be with a higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit, causing the THSA OVM nonstandard friction.- SEC design flaw allowing for a single event, the left landing gear temporary dedecompression, to cause the loss of pitch control by both SECs.The absence of ground spoilers arming for landing in the context of touch and go's training may have contributed to the temporary decompression of the left main landing gear.- The training instructor`s decision for continuation of the flight despite repetitive ELAC PITCH FAULT ECAM caution messages. The lack of clear framework of operational rules for training flights, especially concerning the application of the MEL, and the specific nature of operations that caused pressure to complete the training program may have impacted the crew decision-making process.Contributory factors- Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM does not clearly define the need for arming spoilers when performing touch-and-go training (ATO procedures not in accordance with Airbus SOP). The fact that there is no clear reference in the Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM Touch-And-Go air exercise section to additional procedures that should be used, in combination with lack of understanding of the importance for arming the spoilers during this type of flights contributed to TRI making a decision to disarm the spoilers during touch and go training enabling landing gear bounce on touch down.- At the time of the event Airbus QRH did not define the maximum allowed number of resets for the flight control computers.- At the time of the event Airbus FCTM did not require to consider MEL on touch-and-go and stop-and-go training.- The oil in the THS OVM casing was with higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit.- The aircraft maintenance documentation does not require any test of the OVM during aircraft regular maintenance checks.- Smartlynx Estonia ATO OM does not clearly specify the role in the cockpit for the Safety Pilot. The lack of task sharing during the event caused the ECAM warnings to be left unnoticed andunannounced for a long period.- The crew not resetting the ELAC 1. The fact that ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT was left unreset lead to the degradation of the redundancy of the system.Considering the remoteness of the loss control of both elevators, there is no specific crew training for MECHANICAL BACKUP in pitch during approach, landing and take-off. This condition of the aircraft occurred for the crew in a sudden manner on rotation and during training flight, where the experienced TRI is not in PF role and cannot get immediate feedback of the aircraft behaviour and condition. Despite these difficult conditions the crew managed to stabilize and land the aircraft with no major damage to the persons on board. The crew performance factors that contributed to the safe landing of the aircraft are the following- The TRI followed the golden rule of airmanship (fly, navigate, communicate), by stabilizing the aircraft pitch by using the trim wheel and by keeping the aircraft engine power as long as possible;- The Safety Pilot started to play a role in the cockpit by assisting the TRI and student by informing them about the status of the aircraft and later on taking the role of the PM.",Training,ESIB ,2018

Congo.The aircraft departed Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport on a cargo flight to Lubumbashi. A training captain was seated on the right and the trainee captain on the left seat. The third pilot had the role of safety pilot. The trainee captain was on his fifth line training flight.At Lubumbashi, the crew was cleared for an instrument landing procedure for runway 07. In the pre-landing briefing, AUTO BRAKE 2 mode was selected for deceleration of the aircraft. No anomalies or technical malfunctions were reported to ATC.The weather conditions were good with calm winds. On landing, the aircraft landed in the touchdown zone according to the crew, the rollout on the runway appeared normal, and deceleration was progressive. At about 80 knots, the crew noted that the aircraft was diverging to the left of the runway centreline. The crew immediately switched to manual braking, but to no avail, the aircraft continued the skid until it went off the runway and came to a stop, leaving the right main gear on the runway. The nose landing gear, passing over the less compact shoulder, became bogged down and then broke off. The left main landing gear, with the weight of the aircraft, also dug in so that the left engine touched the ground.The aircraft sustained substantial damage in the area of the nose landing gear cage (wheel well).Contributing facts(a) Reduction of simulator training hours for economic reasons for someone who has never performed the duties of controlling an aircraft on the ground.(b) The runway shoulders at Lubumbashi (Luano) do not have the same characteristics with regard to strength (see Annex 14 and Document 9157 Part 3).In conclusion, the actions taken on the rudder before it became ineffective must have been the cause of the aircraft's deviation from the runway centreline and the loss of control of the aircraft (LOC-G).",Cargo,BPEA DR Congo ,2018

The aircraft departed Sharjah, UAE at 1311 UTC on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft entered Tehran FIR fifteen minutes later and the Tehran ACC controller cleared the flight to climb to FL360 according to its flight plan. About 1432, the pilot requested FL380, which was approved. Before reaching that altitude, the left and right airspeeds began to diverge by more than 10 knots. The left (captain's) airspeed indicator showed an increase while the right hand (copilot's) airspeed indicator showed a decrease.A caution aural alert notified the flight crew of the difference. Remarks by the flight crew suggested that an 'EFIS COMP MON' caution message appeared on the EICAS.As the aircraft was climbing, the crew reduced thrust to idle. Approximately 63 seconds later, while approaching FL380, the overspeed aural warning (clacker) began to sound, indicating that the indicated Mach had exceeded M 0.85. Based on the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) of the aircraft, the pilot flying should validate the IAS based on the aircraft flight manual and define the reliable Air Data Computer (ADC) and select the reliable Air Data source. The pilot did not follow this procedure and directly reduced engine power to decrease the IAS after hearing the clacker. The actual airspeed thus reached a stall condition.The copilot tried to begin reading of the 'EFIS COMP MON' abnormal procedure for three times but due to pilot interruption, she could not complete it. Due to decreasing speed, the stall aural warning began to sound, in addition to stick shaker and stick pusher activating repeatedly. The crew then should have referred to another emergency procedure to recover from the stall condition.While the stick pusher acted to pitch down the aircraft to prevent a stall condition, the captain was mistakenly assumed an overspeed situation due to the previous erroneous overspeed warning and pulled on the control column. The aircraft entered a series of pitch and roll oscillations.The autopilot was disengaged by the crew before stall warning, which ended the oscillations. Engine power began to decrease on both sides until both engines flamed out in a stall condition.From that point on FDR data was lost because the electric bus did not continue to receive power from the engine generators. The CVR recording continued for a further approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds on emergency battery power. Stall warnings, stick shaker and stick pusher activations continued until the end of the recording.The aircraft then impacted mountainous terrain.Unstable weather conditions were present along the flight route over Iran, which included moderate up to severe turbulence and icing conditions up to 45000ft. These conditions could have caused ice crystals to block the left-hand pitot tube. It was also reported that the aircraft was parked at Sharjah Airport for three days in dusty weather condition. Initially the pitot covers had not been applied. The formation of dust inside the pitot tube was considered another possibility.The Iranian investigators stated that both TSB Canada and Bombardier Inc. had some limitations to support the Iranian investigation team under U.S. and Canadian law against standard 4.6 of Annex 13 to ICAO convention.Main cause and contributing factorsThe accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of erratic airspeed indication failure by the cockpit crew. Contributing factors were- The aircraft designer/manufacturer provided insufficient technical and operational guidance about airspeed malfunctions that previously occurred.- Lack of effective CRM.11-03-201811-03-2018",Executive,AAIB Iran ,2018
12-MAR-2018,DHC-8-402Q Dash 8,S2-AGU,US-Bangla Airlines,51,Kathmandu-Tr...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20180312-0,Landing (LDG),Destroyed,Flightcrew member's mental condition Runway excursion,"US-Bangla Airlines flight 211, a DHC-8-402, departed Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka, Bangladesh at 0651 UTC on a scheduled flight to Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, Nepal. Prior to departure, while in radio contact with Dhaka Ground Control and the airline's Operations department, the captain shows signs that he was agitated and experiencing high levels of stress. As the aircraft was in a climb phase, the captain overheard a communication between Operations and another US-Bangla aircraft regarding the fuel onboard but the captain without verifying whether the message was meant for him or not, engaged in some unnecessary conversation with the Operations staff. The Captain's vocal pitch and language used again indicated that he was very much emotionally disturbed and experiencing high level of stress.The aircraft established its first contact with Kathmandu Control at 0752 UTC. At 0807 the First Officer contacted Kathmandu Control and requested descent clearance. Kathmandu Control cleared the flight to descend to FL160 with an estimated approach time of 0826 which was acknowledged by the First Officer. At 0810 the flight was handed over to Kathmandu Approach. At 0811, Kathmandu Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 13500 feet and hold over GURAS. The crew inserted the HOLD in the Flight Management System.At 0813 Kathmandu Approach further instructed the aircraft to reduce its speed and descend to 12500 feet. Three minutes later a further descent clearance was given to 11500 feet, and the flight was cleared for a VOR approach to runway 02 maintaining minimum approach speed. Both crew members forgot to cancel the hold on the FMS as they were engaged in some unnecessary conversation.Upon reaching GURAS, the aircraft turned left to enter the holding pattern over GURAS, which was noticed by both crew members and immediately the captain made a correction. At the same time they were alerted by Approach Control. The captain immediately selected a heading of 027° which was just 5° of interception angle to intercept the desired radial of 202° inbound to KTM. The spot wind recorded was westerly at 28kt. The aircraft continued approach on heading mode and crossed radial 202° at 7 DME of KTM VOR. The aircraft then continued on the same heading of 027° and deviated to the right of the final approach course.Having deviated to the right of the final approach path, the aircraft reached about 2-3 NM North east of the KTM VOR and continued to fly further northeast. At 0827, Kathmandu Tower (TWR) alerted the crew that the landing clearance was given for runway 02 but the aircraft was proceeding towards runway 20. At 0829, Tower Controller asked the crew of their intention to which the captain replied that they would be landing on runway 02. The aircraft then made an orbit to the right. The Controller instructed the aircraft to join downwind for runway 02 and report when sighting another Buddha Air aircraft which was already on final for runway 02. The aircraft instead of joining downwind leg for runway 02, continued on the orbit to the right on a westerly heading towards Northwest of runway 20. The controller instructed the aircraft to remain clear of runway 20 and continue to hold at the present position as the Buddha Air aircraft was landing on runway 02 (from the opposite side) at that time. After the landing of the Buddha Air aircraft, the Tower Controller, at 0832 UTC gave a choice to BS211 to land either on runway 20 or 02 but the aircraft again made an orbit to the right, this time northwest of runway 20.While continuing with the turn through a southeastern direction, the captain reported that he had the runway in sight and requested tower for clearance to land. The Tower Controller cleared the aircraft to land but when the aircraft was still turning for the runway it approached very close to the threshold of runway 20 on a westerly heading and not aligned with the runway. At 083327 UTC, spotting the aircraft maneuvering at very close proximity to the ground and not aligned with the runway, the Tower Controller hurriedly cancelled the landing clearance of the aircraft by saying, ""Takeoff clearance cancelled"".Within the next 15-20 seconds, the aircraft pulled up in westerly direction and with very high bank angle turned left and flew over the western area of the domestic apron, continued on a southeasterly heading past the ATC Tower and further continued at a very low height, flew over the domestic southern apron area and finally attempted to align with the runway 20 to land.During this process, while the aircraft was turning inwards and momentarily headed towards the control tower, the tower controllers ducked down out of fear that the aircraft might hit the tower building. Missing the control tower, when the aircraft further turned towards the taxi track aiming for the runway through a right reversal turn, the tower controller made a transmission by saying, ""BS 211, I say again..."". At 0834 UTC the aircraft touched down 1700 meters down the threshold with a bank angle of about 15 degrees and an angle of about 25 degrees with the runway axis (approximately heading Southeast) and to the left of the center line of runway 20, then veered southeast out of the runway through the inner perimeter fence along the rough down slope and finally stopped about 442 meters southeast from the first touchdown point on the runway. All four crew members (2 cockpit crew and 2 cabin crew) and 45 out of the 67 passengers onboard the aircraft were killed in the accident. Two more passengers succumbed to injury later in hospital during course of treatment. The aircraft caught fire after 6 seconds of touchdown which engulfed major portions of the aircraft.An investigation into the captain's behaviour showed that he had history of depression while serving in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 and was removed from active duty after evaluation by a psychiatrist. He was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist in January 2002 and was declared to be fit for flying. Examinations in successive annual medical checks were not focused on his previousmedical condition of depression, possibly because this was not declared in the self-declaration form for annual medicals.During the flight the captain was irritable, tensed, moody, and aggressive at various times. He was smoking during the flight, contrary to company regulations. He also used foul language and abusive words in conversation with the junior female first officer. He was engaged in unnecessary conversation during the approach, at a time when sterile cockpit rules were in force.The captain seemed very unsecure about his future as he had submitted resignation from this company, though only verbally. He said he did not have any job and did not know what he was going to do for living.The Probable CausesThe Accident Investigation Commission determines that the probable cause of the accident is due to disorientation and a complete loss of situational awareness in the part of crewmember.Contributing to this the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe attitude to align with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude. There was no attempt made to carry out a go around, when a go around seemed possible until the last instant before touchdown on the runway.Contributing Factorsa. Improper timing of the pre-flight briefing and the commencement of the flight departure in which the operational pre-flight briefing was given in early morning but the flight departure time was around noon and there were four domestic short flights scheduled in between.b. The PIC, who was the pilot flying, seemed to be under stress due to behavior of a particular female colleague in the company and lack of sleep the preceding night.c. A very steep gradient between the crew.d. Flight crew not having practiced visual approach for runway 20 in the simulator.e. A poor CRM between the crew.12-03-201812-03-201812-03-20182001C-FGNPBombardier30 April 2001N385BCBombardier Capital19 May 2001LN-RDXSAS Scandinavian Airlines3 July 2002N533DSBombardier Capital17 October 2005C-FFUVBombardier24 October 2005JY-ASMRoyal Jordanian Airlines22 Jan. 2008C-FRGTBombardier22 May 2008D-ADHRAugsburg Airways28 Oct. 2013D-ADHRAugsburg Airways30 May 2014S2-AGUUS-Bangla Airlines4 Sep. 2015S2-AGUUS-Bangla Airlines",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIC Nepal ,2018

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The captain, first officer, and the three passengers on board the airplane were not injured.The purpose of the flight was to provide logistical support of ICEX 2018, which involves, in part, U.S. Navy and U.K Royal Navy submarines operating beneath the frozen Arctic Ocean during a 5-week exercise. The flight used an airstrip on the sea ice that was lined on both sides with snow berms. The airstrip included one runway oriented north/south and an intersecting runway oriented east/west. Weather conditions at the time of the accident consisted of clear skies with ice pack haze. The sun was low on the horizon, resulting in shadows on the airstrip, and flat light conditions made it difficult to discern topographical features.The pedestrian reported that, just before the two pilots boarded the airplane, he told the captain that he would position himself alongside the airstrip so that he could photograph the airplane at departure. As the airplane back-taxied before takeoff, the pedestrian positioned himself clear of the airstrip and behind a 3- to 4-ft-tall snow berm. He said that, as the airplane's takeoff progressed, it did not climb as quickly as it had during previous departures and that the last thing he remembered before the collision was seeing the left wing getting lower to the ground as the airplane began a left turn and flew toward him while continuing to accelerate.A security video camera recorded the accident sequence, and the recording supported the pedestrian's account of the sequence of events. Although the captain reported that he climbed the airplane before initiating a left turn, the review of the video revealed that the flight crew operated the airplane at a low altitude and along a flightpath that placed it in dangerous proximity to the pedestrian (which was inconsistent with federal regulations) and left no margin to avoid the collision with him.A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing and left aileron. The pedestrian sustained a serious head and neck injuries because of the collision, and he was subsequently medevacked to Anchorage, Alaska for treatment.Probable Cause The flight crew's improper decision to deliberately operate the airplane at low altitude and along a flightpath that resulted in a collision with a pedestrian after takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the pedestrian's proximity to the runway.20-03-2018",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2018

However, the exact cause of the loss of the nut could not be determined.However, examination of the left and right landing gear door fasteners of F-GPYF, as well as those of the HOP! fleet of ATR 42 aircraft, revealed defects in the conformity of these assemblies.The investigation revealed errors in the generic maintenance documentation that may lead to the installation of out-of-date screw/nut combinations. The consequences of these deviations from good practice on the performance of the assembly could not be precisely determined during the investigation but may lead to a loss of function of the assembly.Thus, the following combinations of organizational and human factors potentially contributed to the loosening and subsequent unscrewing of the nut on the rear assembly of the left main landing gear door- The ATR maintenance documentation concerning the choice of nuts to be used as an alternative to P/N IPC is complex and contains errors that could lead to an inadequate P/N nut choice ;- The information on the torque to be applied on this nut and for all these alternatives was missing from the ATR maintenance documentation;- The generic ATR maintenance documentation allows the reuse of nuts without checking their self-locking capacity.

Arriving on final approach at the airport, the limited visibility prompted the crew to carry out a go-around and divert to Bamako. In the early afternoon, judging that the conditions were improving, the crew took off again and made it to the final approach on the laterite runway 07R of Gao. With visibility reduced to 3,000 metres and the runway difficult to spot, the crew requested Gao air traffic control to mark the runway threshold with flashing lights.The crew only perceived this secondary runway late and made corrections to line up on the runway axis on short final. As a result, the approach was not stabilized. This unstable final approach resulted in a late and poorly controlled flare.The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced back three times. One or more of these contacts with the runway produced excessive forces on the nose gear and its fracture.The aircraft slid over the front of the fuselage for 500 metres before coming to rest. The crew shut down the engines and systems, then evacuated the aircraft on their own.Causes of the eventThe causes of this event are environmental, organizational and human factors.The following factors contributed to the late detection of the active runway- reduced visibility conditions due to haze (less than 3,000 metres);- the absence of contrast of the laterite runway with the surrounding terrain;- the lack of effectiveness of portable lighting installed at the runway threshold at the crew's request.The following factors contributed to an unstable final approach and a late and poorly controlled flare- the focus of attention on the landing, leading to a poorly executed landing without a go-around;- operational pressure to deliver fresh food on time;- the emulation induced by the performance of another crew from the same company who may have landed earlier in Gao under the same conditions;- the fatigue accumulated by the sequence of flights and the weather conditions, which are conducive to errors of judgment and delays in decision-making;- the organisation of the cockpit not promoting synergy within the crew.",Cargo,BEA-É ,2018

The private pilot and passenger of the Cessna 150 sustained fatal injuries and the pilot and 4 passengers of the Cessna 525 were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area. The Cessna 150 was departing on runway 15 at MZZ a local VFR personal flight and the Cessna 525 was landing on runway 22 after an IFR flight that originated from Jackson, Michigan, USA.Examination of the accident site showed that the Cessna 150 had struck the empennage of the Cessna 525 at the intersection of runways 15 and 22. Evidence at the intersection showed that the airplanes came together perpendicular to each other. The Cessna 150 then impacted the ground and a post-crash fire ensued. The Cessna 525 continued to roll out on runway 22. Witnesses stated that they heard the Cessna 150 pilot on runway 15 UNICOM frequency. The surviving pilot of the Cessna 525 stated that he did not see the departing Cessna 150 while he was on a straight-in approach to runway 22, nor did he see the 150 during the landing roll. He stated that he did not recall making a radio call on UNICOM, but did utilize his on board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system while on approach. He stated that the TCAS did not show any traffic on the airport. The reported weather at MZZ at the time of the accident was VFR with 4 miles of visibility due to haze. Also, at the departure and arrival ends of runway 15/33, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using Runway 4/22 Cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" At the departure and arrival ends of runway 4/22, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using 15/33 cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" The MZZ airport does not have a control tower.Probable Cause The failure of both pilots to see and avoid the other airplane as they converged on intersecting runways. Contributing to the accident was the jet pilot's not monitoring the airport's traffic advisory frequency, known reduced visibility of the intersecting runways, and hazy weather condition.02-04-201802-04-201802-04-201802-04-201802-04-2018",Private,NTSB ,2018

The plane landed safely at the second approach 15 minutes later. No personal injuries were reported. The aircraft departed Jeju, South Korea at 2024 hours with the captain as Pilot Flying on the leg to Osaka-Kansai. The landing briefing commenced at around 2059 prior to the descent did not include information regarding a tailwind at the time of the landing.As the aircraft had commenced the ILS approach to runway 06L, the controller reported wind from 030° at 3 kt. Both the autopilot and the auto-throttle of the aircraft were disengaged at around a radio altitude of 1,200 ft. In addition, the aircraft continued a stabilized approach. The captain, who was assuming that a landing would be made with a tailwind component, planned to put the thrust levers to their idle position earlier than usual when performing a flare in order to prevent that a touchdown would be long down on the runway.At around 213254, the captain moved the thrust levers to their idle position along with initiating the flare at 2° pitch angle at a radio altitude of about 30 ft. Although the captain tried to continue raising the nose and to reduce the rate of descent, the timing of such maneuvers was slightly delayed. Reducing the rate of descent was infeasible because the thrust levers had already been set to their idle position. The captain tried to reduce the rate of descent of the aircraft by pulling the control column further.The first officer, who felt the rate of descent was large, pulled the control column to reduce the rate of descent without making any call-out. Having noticed the operation of the FO, the captain kept the control column so as to follow the FO's operation.At around 213257, the right main landing gear of the aircraft touched down at pitch angle of about 3.5°, and all spoilers began to deploy when the auto speed brake was activated.Subsequently, after the left main landing gear had touched down, the aircraft bounced. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded in the FDR during this period was 1.87 G.The captain, who was unable to predict the degree of the bounce and assumed that the impact accompanied by the touchdown after the bounce would be hard, executed a go-around maneuver. The pitch angle of the aircraft immediately before executing the go-around was about 5°. The aircraft started climbing positively at about 10° pitch angle after its both main landing gears touched down again approximately one second after it had executed the go-around. The aircraft landed on runway 06L conducting the ILS approach again after flying in accordance with the missed approach procedure.Both the flight crew members did not recognize that the aircraft had struck the runway until the scratch marks were found on the lower aft fuselage by mechanics after the aircraft arrived at the allotted parking spot. The scrape mark on the runway was 15 meters long.PROBABLE CAUSESIn this accident, it is highly probable that the lower aft fuselage of the aircraft was damaged with contacting the runway because its pitch angle became too high during the go-around following the bounce at the time of the landing.Regarding the pitch angle became too high, it is somewhat likely that because the Captain, who thought the impact after the bounce would become hard and tried to avoid the second touchdown, performed large nose up maneuver.09-04-2018",International Scheduled Passenger,JTSB ,2018

After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 2,500 feet msl, and proceeded southbound towards Atqasuk. The pilot said that as the airplane neared Atqasuk, with the autopilot engaged, the airplane descended to about 1,500 feet msl, but then he noticed an area of low fog around Atqasuk. He said that when the airplane was about two miles from the airport, he heard the audible autopilot disengagement annunciator tone sound, which was immediately followed by the pilot's control column pitching forward. The pilot said that he was unable to pull the control column back, and the airplane subsequently descended into instrument meteorological conditions. He said that the airplane continued to descend into the fog, then it struck the snow-covered tundra, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.A North Slope Borough Search and Rescue helicopter pilot told the NTSB that while en route from Utqiagvik to the accident site he encountered ice fog, reduced visibility, and flat light conditions that made it difficult to discern topographical features on the snow-covered tundra. He noted that as the flight continued, both pilots noticed ice beginning to accumulate on the helicopter's windscreen, so the decision was made to abort the search and rescue flight, and the helicopter returned to Utqiagvik.

The pilot left her home about 1930. The pilot's friend thought that the pilot would be going to a hotel because it was getting dark, but FCI security video showed that the pilot arrived at the airport at 2002 and walked to the airplane at 2004.

About 1104, when the aircraft was climbing through FL325, the no.1 engine (CFM56-7B24) suffered an uncontained failure. The flight crew noticed that the no.1 engine rpm dropped to zero, as did the oil pressure. The cabin altitude horn sounded and the aircraft experienced a sudden, uncommanded, left roll of a 41° bank angle. The pilots leveled the wing, donned their oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. The flight crew then requested air traffic control to give them vectors to the nearest suitable airport.As a result of the uncontained failure, a fan blade and parts of the engine cowling and engine air inlet cowl had separated. Debris impacted a window frame of row 14, causing the window and frame to break away. This resulted in a decompression of the aircraft. Additional debris impacted and damaged the leading edge of the left hand wing.The flight was vectored towards Philadelphia Airport, where the crew requested an extended final approach due to concerns of aircraft controllability. It was decided to land with flaps 5 for that reason, and an approach speed of 165 knots. The aircraft landed on runway 27L at 1119 hours and the aircraft was stopped on a taxiway. ARFF services attended to the no.1 engine while injured passenger who was seated near the lost window was rushed to hospital. The passenger is reported to have died.Preliminary findings of the NTSB show that the no.13 fan blade of engine no.1 was missing. It appears to have broken away at the hub. There is evidence of metal fatigue in the area where the blade broke.Also, a part of the no.1 engine cowling was reported to have been found at Burnville, PA.Probable Cause The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of this accident was a low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 13, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the engine fan case at a location that was critical to the structural integrity and performance of the fan cowl structure. This impact led to the in-flight separation of fan cowl components, including the inboard fan cowl aft latch keeper, which struck the fuselage near a cabin window and caused the window to depart from the airplane, the cabin to rapidly depressurize, and the passenger fatality.17-04-201817-04-201817-04-201817-04-201817-04-201817-04-201817-04-201817-04-201817-04-2018",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2018

The forecast weather at Newquay was for overcast cloud at 400 - 500 ft with a gusty crosswind of approximately 20 kt. The co-pilot was pilot flying for the Newquay sector.The takeoff, cruise and descent were uneventful. During the cruise the commander obtained updated weather via the ATIS for Newquay, which gave landing runway 12, the surface wind 210/16 and cloud broken at 400 ft. The flight crew briefed for the approach, discussing the threat of turbulence on final and the potential for a go-around. The pilots planned to use flap 15 for the final approach because no gusts were reported on the ATIS, and to set the propeller condition levers to max in case a go-around was required.The aircraft was established on final for runway 12 at 8 nm and the co-pilot disconnected the autopilot at approximately 500 ft. At approximately 400 ft, the aircraft became displaced from the runway centreline and the co-pilot elected to go around. The goaround was uneventful and the aircraft was repositioned for a second approach. During the downwind leg the commander made a PA to reassure the passengers then briefed the co-pilot to keep the autopilot engaged until slightly later in the approach and to ensure the speed remained between the VREF and VCLIMB speed bugs.The second approach was stable until approximately 50 ft. The tower gave the surface wind as 190°/20 kt. At approximately 50 ft the co-pilot reduced power to flight idle to control the airspeed, although neither pilot was aware that the power had been reduced this much. At approximately 30 ft above the runway, the aircraft started to sink rapidly and the commander called ""power, power, power"". The co-pilot increased power and pitched up to arrest the rate of descent, but the aircraft landed firmly, striking its tail on the runway. The aircraft bounced and the commander took control. Observing the TOUCHED RUNWAY light he elected to continue the landing. The aircraft landed and taxied to the gate without further incident. Subsequently one cabin crew member reported minor back pain. No other injuries were reported.Damage was found to several skin panels, frames, stringers and aft pressure bulkhead.Conclusion ""The tailstrike occurred because the pilot flying reacted instinctively to the high sink rate by increasing pitch attitude and power, rather than increasing power only. The aircraft manufacturer recommends that operators provide annual recurrent training in pitch awareness for flight crew to establish the correct response to high sink rate near the ground.""17-04-2018",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2018

The Boeing 737-800 registered PK-LOO operated on a flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on this flight. On board the flight were 181 persons, consisted of two pilots, five flight attendants and 174 passengers. The flight departed Makassar at 1728 local time and cruised at an altitude of FL330. The flight until descent was uneventful.Prior to commencing their descent, the crew received the latest weather information from the Jalaluddin Tower controller wind calm, visibility 2,500 meters, slight rain, cloud FEW CB (cumulonimbus) 800 feet and overcast 800 feet, temperature 26°C, dew point 24 °C, QNH 1008 hPa and QFE 1006 hPa with additional remarks of CB in the approach area.During the descent, at 1828, Jalaluddin Tower advised the pilot to descend to 5,800 feet and issued a clearance to carry out a VOR/DME approach to runway 27.At 1832, the Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that there was rain over the field and requested the aircrafts position. The PM acknowledged the information and reported that the aircraft was on final course runway 27.One minute later a pilot of an ATR aircraft that previously landed informed to JT892 that when they were making the approach, there was heavy rain in the final approach area. The PM acknowledged the information. There was no pilot discussion to anticipate the reported heavy rain.The Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind direction was 150° with velocity of 7 knots, QNH 1008 hPa and issued landing clearance if the pilot was able to see the runway. The PM acknowledged the message and would inform when they were able to see the runway.The pilot requested for high intensity of runway lights and was informed that the runway light had been set to maximum intensity.At 1834, the PM informed the Jalaluddin Tower controller that the runway was in sight. The Jalaluddin Tower controller then issued landing clearance for JT892 since the controller was able to see the aircraft landing lights.At 1840, the aircraft touched down, the autobrake operated, the spoiler automatically deployed and the PF selected the engine thrust reversers.

All nine occupants suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft was attached to the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and had been undergoing routine maintenance in Savannah before heading to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona.The MA had been at Savannah for almost a month, since 9 April 2018, to undergo prescheduled fuel cell maintenance and unscheduled work on engine number one by 156 AW maintenance personnel using the facilities of the 165th Airlift Wing. During takeoff roll, engine no.1 RPM fluctuated and did not provide normal RPM when the captain advanced the throttle lever into the flight range for takeoff. Approximately eight seconds prior to aircraft rotation, engine no.1 RPM and torque significantly decayed, which substantially lowered thrust. The fluctuation on roll and significant performance decay went unrecognized by the crew until rotation, when the captain commented on aircraft control challenges and the aircraft veered left and nearly departed the runway into the grass before it achieved flight. As the crew retracted the landing gear, they identified the engine no.1 RPM and torque malfunction and the captain called for engine shutdown. However, the crew failed to complete the Takeoff Continued After Engine Failure procedure, the Engine Shutdown procedure, and the After Takeoff checklist as directed by the Flight Manual, and the aircraft's flaps remained at 50 percent. Additionally, the captain banked left into the inoperative engine, continued to climb, and varied left and right rudder inputs.

The first officer, who was line flying under supervision, was Pilot Flying while the captain, who had a Flight Instructor Rating, was Pilot Monitoring on the flight.The flight was uneventful, the weather conditions were favourable, and the crew requested a visual approach for a landing on runway 10 at Marrakech, which was received at 5NM from the ODALO point, allowing the crew to have a long final approach of about 20NM before landing. The ILS frequency was selected for both pilots, while the FD was switched off when the clearance was received for a visual approach.At 200ft agl the aircraft was below glide path, the first officer corrected by increasing thrust without controlling the vertical path being, causing the aircraft to be high on the glide path. The trainee first officer then reduced thrust (almost to idle) to catch up with the glide path by descending to the runway at 100 feet above ground level, with a very high descent rate.It was at this point that the instructor pilot had to make a decision to either take control to correct the course, or abort the landing and do a go-around as the approach was no longer stabilised and the first officer's corrections were excessive.As the first officer had 500 hours on the type, the captain decided not to take control. Thrust was increased to decrease the rate of descent. The aircraft then made a hard landing with bounce. When the wheels touched the ground during the landing, the captain finally decided to take control. He also decided to reduce thrust further, to avoid a long landing after the bounce.As the aircraft was at a higher height than the recommended flare height, this manoeuvre was poorly executed with a nose-up attitude exceeding the values required for a safe landing.Despite the pilot's action on the control column to remedy the situation, this did not prevent the aft fuselage from contacting the runway.Probable causes of the accident- Inappropriate execution of the landing procedure by the flight crew;- Inappropriate correction by the first officer to catch up with the landing path; - Delayed reaction by the captain to rectify the situation; - Inadequate response by the first officer to the landing procedure;- Late reaction by captain to remedy this situation;- Inadequate decision by the captain to continue the landing.Contributing factors- Lack of experience in the first officer;- Unfamiliar terrain for the first officer;- Lack of experience of the Type Rating Instructor pilot.",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA Maroc ,2018

The damage to the aircraft was limited to the left main landing gear leg and to part of the left wing, which was affected by deformations and the collapse of the left landing gear leg.A subsequent inspection showed that the bolt that attaches the aft trunnion pin to the trunnion was installed incorrectly, which allowed the trunnion pin to shift to the rear, decoupling from the trunnion and causing the leg to collapse. The bolt was also verified to be incorrectly installed in the right landing gear leg, although the trunnion pin did not come out of its fitting and the right leg remained in its position.The collapse of the left landing gear leg was caused by an error when installing the aft bolt into the trunnion pin, which allowed the trunnion pin to move in the trunnion fitting inthe aft wing spar.The installation mistake in the main landing gear legs and the accumulation of other minor errors indicate that the maintenance facilities of the aircraft manufacturer, Textron Aviation, do not have standard installation (removal) procedures that are known to all of the personnel involved.Causes/Contributing factors The collapse of the left landing gear leg was caused by the improper installation of the bolt in the trunnion pin, which allowed the pin to move inside the trunnion and the trunnion fitting in the aft wing spar.04-05-2018",Executive,CIAIAC ,2018

The aircraft came down in vegetation near a railway outside the airport, broke up and burst into flames. There were 107 passengers on board along with six Mexican crew members. Three passengers initially survived the accident. One survivor died on May 21 and a second died on May 25.The aircraft was owned and operated by Mexican airline Damojh Aerolíneas, operating as Global Air, on behalf of Cubana. XA-UHZ began its operations in Cuba starting May 14, 2018.On May 18, the day of the accident, the aircraft flew a trip from Havana to Santiago de Cuba and back, arriving at Havana at 1020 hours local time. The next trip to be flight 972 to Holguín, Cuba, with a scheduled departure time of 1100 hours.In the preparation for this flight calculations were made of takeoff weight and weight distribution. The cabin configuration on the load sheet differed from the actual configuration of XA-UHZ. Based on these data the Centre of Gravity (CG) was calculated to be at 17.4%. Actually it was 28.5%, close to the rear limit of the aircraft, which is 29%. Consequently the horizontal stabilizer trim was set at 5 3/4 units, instead of 3 1/4 units.At 1200 hours the flight was cleared to start the engines. Subsequently the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 06 for departure. In between working the checklists, the crew were engaged in non-flight related conversations. After receiving clearance for takeoff, the aircraft began to accelerate down runway 06. As soon as it rotated from the runway, the aircraft attained a nose-high and right wing low attitude. The GPWS warning began to sound in the cockpit ""Bank angle, bang angle!"" The bank angle reached 35° before the aircraft rolled back. It banked right and left several times with the nose reaching about 30 degrees nose up. The crew issued a Mayday call. The aircraft lost speed and began an uncontrolled descent until it impacted the ground about 40 seconds after lifting off the runway.Most likely causes (translated from Spanish)The CEIAA has considered that the most probable cause of the accident was the collapse of the aircraft, as a consequence of its entry into abnormal positions immediately after the separation of the landing gear from the runway surface (Lift off) during take-off, which led to the loss of control due to a chain of errors, with a preponderance in the human factor.Contributing factors- inconsistencies in crew training;- errors in weight and balance calculations;- low operational standards manifested in flight.18-05-201818-05-201818-05-201815 July 1979N769NBoeing7 August 1979N769NPiedmont Airlines27 Nov.1988N227AUPiedmont Airlines5 August 1989N227AUUSAir27 Feb. 1997N227AUUS Airways27 Sep. 2000C-FRYHRoyal Airlines1 May 2001C-FRYHCanada 3000 Airlines19 Oct. 2001N227AUUS Navy16 March 2005XA-MAKMagnichartersAug. 2007XA-UHZGlobal Air2007-2018XA-UHZNACAM - National Airways Cameroon;Avolar;Benin Golf Air;Aero Caribbean;Línea Aérea SINAMI;EasySky Airlines;Cubana",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CEIAA Cuba ,2018

The flight was uneventful until reaching flight level 370. At 1746, the flight reported to ATC that they encountered a malfunction of the green hydraulic system followed by a ""green hydraulic system reservoir low level"" warning, and requested to hold for coordination and decision. The flight crew decided to return back, but due to weather conditions at Madinah and operational considerations, they decided to divert to Jeddah, which is the main base for their operations.At 1759, the flight crew advised ATC of their intention to divert to Jeddah and the need to perform fuel-burn holdings, to be within maximum landing weight limitation.Initial approach to Jeddah was initiated at 2003, the flight crew applied manual (free fall) landing gear extension procedures. However, the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) did not display a green triangle for the nose wheel on the wheel page. The flight crew coordinated with the control tower to conduct a low pass to confirm the nose gear extension. At 2019, the first low pass was conducted above runway 16C with no confirmation from the controller. A second low pass was conducted at 2122 on the same runway. However, neither the control tower nor ground staff were able to confirm the nose gear extension.

At 1230, while the aircraft was descending, the pilot contacted the Nice Approach controller and requested authorization to perform an approach via the EM point. The controller contacted the Nice Info controller by phone to inform him of the aircraft's arrival. After this contact, he informed the pilot that there was heavy rain, visibility four kilometers at the destination and asked him what his intentions were. The pilot replied that he was reducing speed to minimum and requested a heading to avoid bad weather.The controller agreed and asked him to contact the Nice Info controller. Nice Info told the pilot to continue as previously cleared and to keep him informed of his intentions. The pilot replied that he would wait for the showers to end at La Môle and then make an approach via the EM point. The controller replied to call him back when he was ready to turn to the EM point and asked him to descend to FL60. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he could not contact the AFIS agent at La Môle and asked him to tell him when the showers had passed. The controller agreed and contacted the La Môle AFIS agent by telephone to ask him to keep him informed of the progress of the showers. Three minutes later, although he had not received any information on the weather evolution, the pilot asked to turn towards the EM point. In the following minutes, the pilot requested several course changes for weather avoidance. After reaching the EM point, the controller cleared him for a visual approach to runway 24 and then asked him to contact the La Môle AFIS agent. The latter indicated that he was alone in the aerodrome circuit, asked him to call back on final approach and gave him the wind conditions (030°, 3 kt). The pilot made a first approach, which he interrupted because he could not see the runway due to clouds. He indicated to the AFIS agent that he was returning to the EM point. The AFIS agent gave him the wind conditions (040°, 4 kt) and asked him to call back on final approach. While the aircraft was heading towards EM , the AFIS agent reported the cloud cover (scattered clouds at 1800 ft). Two minutes later, the pilot asked for visibility on the final approach. The AFIS agent indicated a visibility of 4 to 5 km, before informing him that he had it in sight and giving him the last wind conditions (070°, 3 kt). On the approach the true speed of the plane varied between 145 kt and 150 kt. The aircraft touched the runway 200 m after the threshold of runway, at a true airspeed of 136 kt. The pilot set the flaps to ""full ground"" and the spoilers deployed. The aircraft crossed taxiway B thirteen seconds later, at a true airspeed of 77 kt. It continued onto the paved strip beyond the end of runway 24 and veered left. It left the paved surface at a true airspeed of 41 kts and descended into the river below. The aircraft's nose struck the opposite bank hard. The pilot was able to evacuate the aircraft through the emergency exit located at the rear and right side of the aircraft. It appeared that the landing distance of the aircraft on a wet runway as defined in the AFM performance tables was not compatible with the runway length available at La Môle Airfield. During the preparation of the flight, the pilot used the flight file provided by the operator to determine the landing performance. The landing distance on a wet runway presented in this file increased the landing distance on a dry runway by 15%. However for commercial operations, 60% must be added.Furthermore, on final approach, the aircraft speed was higher than the reference speed on approach and the approach slope was also higher than the nominal slope, which resulted in an increase in landing distance.Contributing factors- The operator's use of the same operations manual for two different types of operations;- The absence in the operations manual of a calculation method, coefficient and safety margin for the calculation of performance in non-commercial transport;- Lack of knowledge by the pilot and the operator of the method of calculation of landing performance in non-commercial transport;- The lack of indication in the operations manual that the landing performances at La Môle aerodrome are limiting in case of a wet or contaminated runway.06-06-2018",Private,BEA ,2018

It was being operated by a single pilot who had considerable experience on both the aircraft type and in operating in the Falkland Islands. This was his first day back after a period of leave, having returned to the Falkland Islands the previous day from a stay overseas.Weddell Island was experiencing a southerly wind at the time the pilot took off so he was expecting to land on runway 13 at Beaver Island. Whilst downwind for runway 13 he contacted his destination by radio to be informed that the wind strength and directionfavoured instead an approach to runway 27. The pilot then repositioned the aircraft for runway 27, rolling out of the final turn on short final. Video footage taken by the passengers on board recorded that about 8 seconds after rolling out onto final the stall warning horn sounded, quickly followed by an impact as the aircraft appeared to touch down hard. The pilot reported that he had felt the right wing drop just before the impact.A later inspection revealed marks from the left wheel on a small bank about 14.5 m short of the start of the runway undershoot area and from the right wheel about 12.4 m short. There were further marks from both wheels indicating the aircraft had struck further banks before both wheels remained on the ground 3.5 m inside the undershoot area. During the subsequent landing roll the aircraft veered initially to the right but the pilot managed to keep it under control. He taxied the aircraft clear of the runway before shutting down. On inspecting the aircraft it was apparent there was significant damage to the right landing gear, engine mounts and wing.ConclusionsThe evidence indicates it is likely the aircraft stalled, or suffered an unexpected descent, on final approach whilst at low height, just short of the undershoot area. This was probably caused by a combination of the low approach speed, necessary to operate to the short strip, and turbulence or windshear caused by the topography of the local area under the prevailing wind conditions. The pilot commented that the stall warner often sounds just prior to touch down and the fact it sounded on this occasion did not necessarily indicate a full stall of the aircraft.Despite the challenges offered by the airstrip, the pilot was experienced and capable of operating under the prevailing conditions. The pilot was confident that despite his recent travel back to the Falkland Islands fatigue was not a contributory factor. The pilot also commented that it is not unusual in this sort of operation to fly only a short final approach, but it is possible that the late repositioning due to the change of landing runway contributed to the handling of the flight, just prior to touchdown.As a result of the accident, the operator conducted its own review. This determined that whilst the strips on Beaver Island complied with relevant requirements, as a further precaution some of the banks short of the undershoot areas would be levelled off.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2018

There were no injuries among the 176 occupants.Prior to departure from Antalya, the flight crew did not obtain the most recent weather reports and forecasts for Kiev.At the time of the approach a thunderstorm was passing the airport. The specific weather conditions were reported on the ATIS channel, but the flight crew did not listen out this frequency. The flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 08. However, at an altitude of 1000 feet, the approach was not stabilized. The flight crew should have aborted the approach, but the captain decided to continue. The aircraft touched down 7 m to the left of the centreline. Since the spoilers were not armed on approach, they did not automatically release and the flight crew failed to manually release the spoilers. The aircraft remained controlled until the engines entered the reverse thrust value of 1.3 EPR, and after increasing the reverse thrust above 1.3 EPR, the aircraft did not respond to the use of rudder and moved by inertia under the influence of external forces.The MD-83 slid off the side of the runway, sustaining serious damage.CauseThe cause of the accident - rolling out of the runway of the aircraft MD-83 UR-CPR of the airline ""Bravo"", which occurred on June 14, 2018 at the airport Kiev (Zhulyany) during the flight BAY 4406 on the route Antalya-Kiev (Zhulyany), was the decision of the CPS to continue landing at the airport Kiev (Zhulyany) in a thunderstorm at the airport with the following main factors- unstabilized landing approach, starting at an altitude of 1000 feet;- non-release of spoilers by the crew;- incorrect actions of the crew on the application of reverse on a wet runway (EPR> 1,3)Related factors- flight information service in the classified airspace of Ukraine was not fully provided to the crew, which is required by the order of the Ministry of Transport of Ukraine dated 16.04.2003 ? 293;- wind, varying in strength and direction;- the crew were probably not listening to current ATIS messages at Kyiv (Zhulyany) airfield;- there are no landing procedures in the Bravo Airways Operation Manual;- low-quality pre-flight, preparation, reading and execution of the checklists at all stages of the flight",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,NBAAI Ukraine ,2018

The flights of the day planned for the pilots were from Douw Aturure Airport (WABI), Nabire to Sugapa Airstrip (WAYB) and return for three times. The PIC acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the SIC acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on all these flights.After the third flight from Nabire to Bilorai, the aircraft landed safely at Sugapa Airstrip. Prior to the departure to Nabire, there was no report or record of aircraft system malfunction and the aircraft was operated within the approved weight and balance envelope. On board the aircraft were two pilots and 11 passengers.The aircraft departed from in daylight conditions and cruised at an altitude of 10,500 feet. The aircraft was flying in an out through clouds when approaching Nabire.Over checkpoint BRAVO, the pilot made initial contact with Nabire Tower controller and advised that the aircraft was descending and passed altitude of 6,600 feet.During descent after checkpoint BRAVO, the pilot noticed development of clouds along the route and decided to avoid the clouds by deviating the aircraft track to the right of the GPS route.At about 4.5 Nm from NBR VOR/DME, the flight monitoring system of the Spirit Avia Sentosa recorded the aircraft altitude was 2,000 feet.The PM noticed yellow on the aircraft GPS which meant the terrain was between 1,000 feet and 100 feet below the aircraft altitude and advised the PF. The PF decided to disengage the auto pilot, reduced the rate of descend and continued to get visual reference on ground.The PM noticed an ""X"" symbol on the GPS which indicated a potential impact point and advised the PF. The PF was continuing the descent and then the second ""X"" appeared on the GPS. A few second later, the PF noticed terrain ahead and pulled the aircraft. The left side of the aircraft impacted a tree.At about 2 Nm, the pilot advised the controller of the aircraft position and requested to make a landing approach using runway 16. The controller approved the pilot request. The rest of the flight was uneventful and the aircraft landed safely using runway 16 at Nabire.No one injured in this occurrence and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Evidence of impact marks were found on the left side of the aircraft which were on the main landing gear strut, wing strut fairing, wing and horizontal stabilizerThe KNKT concluded the contributing factors as follows- The VFR weather minimum requirement that was not implemented properly made the pilot did not have clear visual of the surrounding area.- The consideration of less risk of flying into clouds and relying to the GPWS's aural alert or having visual contact to the terrain, resulted in the ignorance to the GPS alert and continuation of the descend while flying into clouds.18-06-201818-06-201818-06-2018",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSC Indonesia ,2018

The flight crew performed a go around and diverted to Nador Airport.The aircraft operated on a flight from Casablanca to Al Hoceima and Tangier (AT438) and return (AT439). During the first leg, the ""TERRAIN"" warning message was displayed and the amber ""TERRAIN FAULT"" light illuminated, probably related to a degradation of the GPS signal in the area crossed by CN-COH  while at FL160. It disappeared after about 6 minutes and 38 seconds. The crew flew the RNAV approach for Al Hoceima runway 17. Once at MDA (1,030 ft), the captain did not see the runway due to the low cloud ceiling and decided to continue the descent with a descent rate of about 1000 ft/min. One minute later, the ""TERRAIN AHEAD PULL UP"" and ""AVOID TERRAIN"" TAWS alarms were triggered when the aircraft was 1760m from the runway threshold and 60ft radio altitude. The Pilot Flying (PF) then performed a pitch-up attitude change and restored power. The lowest point reached was 45ft radio altitude. The aircraft then climbed to a height of 108 feet, which it maintained until the runway was in sight, and then resumed a descent to land. The third leg of the flight was from Tangier Airport back to Al Hoceima Airport. Due to the short flight time, the approach briefing at Al Hoceima was carried out on the ground in Tangier, at the same time as the departure briefing. This time, the crew prepared a VOR/DME approach, the minima of which were 760 ft. The captain (Pilot Monitoring) explained to the first officer (Pilot Flying) that if the runway was not in sight at the minima, he would descend to 400 ft and maintain this altitude until the runway was in sight, and that if the runway was still not in sight at 2NM from the VOR, the approach would have to be aborted and a go-around would have to be made. In addition, the captain accepted, after consulting the Dispatch Deviation Manual (DDM), the co-pilot's suggestion to stop the GPWS to avoid alarms during the descent and approach, because they believed that the alarms emitted by this system, during the first leg, were untimely. The plane took off from Tangier Airport at 1830 and reached its cruising level of FL130 at 1846. Descent was begun 6 minutes later. Before starting the descent, the captain discussed with the first officer the execution of the approach and gave him advice/instructions. At 1855, the crew contacted the Al Hoceima tower air traffic controller. The controller asked the crew to confirm that they wished to conduct a VOR DME approach for runway 17, to which the crew replied in the affirmative. The controller then cleared them to descend to FL60 and asked them to call back on the VOR ALM. The LNAV mode was active. The crew engaged the AP (autopilot) V/S mode with a vertical speed of -1500 ft/min and selected the 6000 ft altitude. The captain instructed the first officer in the procedure with a point ""ALM01"", not on the published procedures, located at ""12.5 NM radial 336°"".  At 1856, the crew carried out a descent checklist, on the initiative of the PM (captain) and during this descent they increased the vertical speed to -1600 ft/min then to -1800 ft/min with an indicated speed of 230Kt. The captain reminded the first officer of the manoeuvres to be carried out in the event of a go-around and announced to the first officer that during the approach, he (the captain) would take care of monitoring ""speed and water"" and he (first officer) would take care of piloting. Shortly before reaching 6000ft, at 1858, the Indicated Speed of 210kt and an altitude of 3000ft were selected.The crew selected the 3000-foot altitude and cross-checked the altimeters at QNH 1016 as they passed 6100 feet. Then the approach checklist was completed. At 185954, the aircraft was 11.5 NM from the threshold of runway 17, speed 220Kt and altitude about 4500 feet, the captain deactivated the GPWS and reminded the first officer twice ""Gear and Flaps for a greater rate of descent"" he explained. At 190016, at 4000 feet altitude, the heading increased from 90° to 148°, the captain said to the first officer ""At two nautical miles you must be at seven hundred ... we take the decision at three nautical miles, then you will maintain 400 feet radio altimeter"". After intercepting the final approach, the speed was reduced to 170Kts. At 190151, the Tower controller reported the latest weather information ""Wind calm, visibility four kilos presence of mist, Overcast at 006, temperature 23, dew point 23, QNH 1016"". The captain replied, ""Roger, continue approach and call back."" The captain then selected an altitude of 400 ft, while the aircraft was 6.4NM from the runway threshold. Subsequently the crew re-engaged the V/S mode with a vertical speed of -1,200 ft/min when the aircraft was 6.2 NM from the runway threshold. At 190214, the captain selected flaps to the 15° position and radioed Al Hoceima Tower ""Did you copy. We are fully established"", after which ATC acknowledged receipt and issued landing clearance. The captain then acknowledged ""Roger"". At the request of the first officer, the captain selected the landing gear down, followed by flaps to the 30° position at a threshold distance of 3.3 NM.At 190333, the aircraft was 2 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of approximately 400 ft. Descent continued at a selected rate of -1800 ft/min, which was later reduced to -1400 ft/min. After descending through 135 ft over the water, the PF said ""this is not normal"" and at a height of 80 feet and a speed of 130 knots, he disengaged the autopilot (AP). For 9 seconds, the PF applies nose-up control column forces while the PM applied nose-down control column forces. The maximum opposite force on the two control columns reached 3 times 68 daN. At 190351, the PF advanced the thrust levers to the 74° position reached in 4 seconds. At 190353, the landing gear was compressed; the aircraft struck the surface of the water twice because the nose-down forces applied to the control column by the PM were greater than the PF's nose-up forces. On the second impact, the aircraft had a nose-down attitude of -3° and experienced a vertical acceleration of 3.92G and a deceleration of 0.42G. This occurred at 2630 meters from the threshold of runway 17. At this time, the PM applied a 40 daN nose-down force while the PF applied a 28 daN nose-up force. Subsequently, the PM's nose-down force decreased while the PF's nose-up force increased and the aircraft regained altitude. The Master Warning, associated with a TO config PWR MGT (PWR MGT in CRZ position during the approach), was activated for one second. The thrust levers were moved back to 67° and the attitude gradually increased to reach 17° to pitch up 10 seconds later. At 190359, when the aircraft was 1.08 NM from the threshold of runway 17, the captain told the first officer to turn and set the flap selector from 30° to 0°. The flaps were retracted to the 0° position about 14 seconds later at 190405. The landing gear was then retracted, and the captain radioed toe Al Hoceima Tower that they were carrying out a go-around, and requested to proceed to Nador Airport. The crew continued their flight, and landed safely at Nador at 1930 Probable causes- The event that occurred on 9 July 2018 to the aircraft, registration CN-COH, during its approach to Al-Hoceima Charif Al Idrissi Airport, would have been due to failure to comply with operational procedures, in particular; the deliberate stopping of the GPWS, the continuation of the unstable approach below the stabilization level and the continuation of the approach beyond the minimum descent altitude (MDA) in the absence of visual references.- The undue shutdown of the GPWS and the absence of Advisory Calls during the approach deprived the crew of any opportunity to recognize and manage the undesired Controlled Flight Toward Terrain situation in which the aircraft was until touchdown.- Item (038-42-02-01) of the Dispatch Deviation Manual, which does not provide an operational instruction (O) for the total GPWS failure, would have supported the flight crew's decision to stop the aircraft without precaution.- The lack of CRM among the flight crew, particularly in terms of communication, coordination, and appropriate dosage between the captain authority gradient and the first officer's level of assertiveness, resulted in the first officer's delay in reacting against the captain's directives, which were incompatible with the limits of the stabilization level and approach minima.The fact remains that the first officer's reaction, even if late, limited the final situation to the material damage to the aircraft.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger, ,2018
10-JUL-2018,Convair CV-340,ZS-BRV,Rovos Air,1,near Pretoria-Won...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20180710-0,Approach (APR),Destroyed,,"On 10 July 2018 the private owner of the aircraft (ZS-BRV), Rovos Rail, entered into a sale agreement of this aircraft with the Luchtvaart Themapark Aviodrome from the Netherlands. As part of the agreement, the aircraft was to be kept in a serviceable condition and registered South Africa. The terms of the agreement included that the aircraft was being sold as is and all costs and responsibilities towards the aircraft were passed over to the Aviodrome. Though the arrangements were finalised between Rovos Rail and Aviodrome, the Certificate of Airworthiness (CoA) and the Certificate of Registry (CoR) were still registered under the current owners (Rovos Rail). The aircraft was to be ferried to the Netherlands on the 12th of July 2018 and expected to arrive in the Netherlands at Lelystad Airport (EHLE) on the 23rd of July 2018. In preparation for ferrying the aircraft, the aircraft had to be painted, serviced, inspected and accepted by Aviodrome representatives. Prior to the accident flight in July 2018, the aircraft was last flown in February 2018. On 6 July 2018 maintenance checks (A, B & C) were performed on the aircraft. The accident flight was the first flight post maintenance.On 10 July 2018 the aircraft took off for a scenic flight from Wonderboom Airport destined for Pilanesberg, with the intention to return back to Wonderboom. The passenger manifest indicates that there were 2 Australian pilots and 17 passengers on board. Among the passengers was a Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer who acted as a member of the crew.Unbeknownst to the crew, Pilanesberg Airport was closed for fixed winged aircraft as indicated in the Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) No. B0930/18, due to the runway being under construction. At the time of take-off (1439Z) the NOTAM had already been published and neither the crew nor Wonderboom ATC were aware of the NOTAM.The captain, seated on the left seat, was the pilot flying (PF) and the first officer (FO), seated on the right seat, was doing the radio work. The engineer was operating the engine controls. After all the run-up checks were concluded, the crew made a request for take-off. The request was acknowledged and granted by the ATC before the aircraft was taxied to runway 29 at 1630.The aircraft then entered the runway, accelerated down the runway and rotated. At the 50 kts call, the captain stated that the manifold pressure was low. After rotation, one of the passengers went to the cockpit and told the engineer that the left engine was on fire. The Air Traffic Controller (ATC) stated that the aircraft then continued North West of the aerodrome over the Bon Accord dam at a distance of approximately 2 to 2.5 miles at about 800 feet, indicating a rate of climb of 600 to 700 feet per minute (fpm).The aircraft continued with the left engine on fire throughout the flight and during the accident sequence. A cockpit GoPro recording also shows that the left engine RPM gauge was fluctuating and that later the left engine fire master caution light was illuminating and an audible warning sound was heard. The control wheel was deflected to the right and the captain indicated that they had lost aileron, and requesting rudder input from the FO. The pilots indicated that they were not sure if they had retracted the landing gears. And although the pilots and engineer were informed of the left engine fire, they were asking each other which engine was on fire. At no stage did the pilots or the engineer discuss or attempt to extinguish the left engine fire, as the left engine fire extinguishing system was never activated. The aircraft could not maintain altitude and first struck power lines spanned parallel Sakabuka street situated in Derdepoort industrial area, North of Pretoria. The aircraft continued for a further 71m before impacting a treetop with its left wing, and continued for a further 17m before impacting a set of treetops with its left wing. At 130m it impacted two commercial vehicles, before colliding with a building (Metal and Milk factories) resulting in the left outboard wing separating and coming to rest in the front of the building with which it collided . The collision destroyed the front and back wall of the building, with its roof together with the rear parameter wall fence, before the left horizontal stabiliser and inboard wing separating at 137m and 143m respectively. The inboard section of the left wing caught fire and continued burning. The main wreckage, right wing and engine came to rest found 250m further on, 6 km to the east of the airport.Probable CauseDuring take-off, the left engine caught fire and the crew continued with the flight without securing the left engine as prescribed in the aircraft flight manual (AFM).The crew declared an emergency and attempted to return to the aerodrome, however, they lost control of the aircraft and collided with power lines prior to crashing into a factory building.Contributory Factors1. Pre-existing damage to the cylinder No 13 piston and ring pack deformation and, most probably, the cylinder No 7s fractured exhaust valve head that were not detected during maintenance of the aircraft.2. Substandard maintenance for failing to conduct compression tests on all cylinders during the scheduled maintenance prior to the accident.3. Misdiagnosis of the left engine manifold pressure defect as it was reported twice prior to the accident.4. The crew not aborting take-off at 50kts prior to reaching V1; manifold pressure fluctuation was observed by the crew at 50kts and that should have resulted in an aborted take-off.5. Lack of crew resource management; this was evident as the crew ignored using the emergency checklist to respond to the in-flight left engine fire.6. Lack of recency training for both the PF and PM, as well as the LAME.7.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Of the 11 occupants on board, the pilot was uninjured, four passengers sustained minor injuries, and six passengers sustained serious injuries.The float plane had departed Steamboat Bay Seaplane Base about 0747 and was headed for Ketchikan, Alaska. The area between Steamboat Bay and Ketchikan consists of remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and steep mountainous terrain.The accident pilot reported to the NTSB that while in level cruise flight at about 1,100 ft mean sea level (MSL), and as the flight progressed into an area known as Sulzer Portage, visibility decreased rapidly from about 3-5 miles to nil. In an attempt to turnaround and return to VFR conditions, he initiated a climbing right turn. Prior to completing the 180° right turn, he saw what he believed to be a body of water and he became momentarily disoriented, so he leveled the wings. Shortly thereafter, he realized that the airplane was approaching an area of snow-covered mountainous terrain, so he applied full power and initiated a steep, emergency climb to avoid rising terrain ahead. As the steep emergency climb continued, the airspeed decayed, and the airplane subsequently collided with an area of rocky, rising terrain. During the initial impact, the airplane's floats were sheared off. The airplane wreckage came to rest in an area known as Jumbo Mountain, sustaining substantial damage to wings and fuselage. The pilot stated that the Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) was in the inhibit mode at the time of the accident. A ""First Alert"" was received from the accident airplane's onboard emergency locator transmitter (ELT) at 0911. About the same time, 911 dispatch in Ketchikan talked to a survivor who provided GPS position and elevation based on data from her iPhone. At 1047 two US Coast Guard helicopters arrived in the search area and one helicopter obtained a weak direction finding (DF) bearing from the ELT at the crash scene. The DF bearing, and the survivor's description of the accident area were used to direct search assets in close proximity to the accident site, so the survivors could hear the USCG helicopters. Two-way radio communications were established between the survivors and USCG by utilizing the accident airplane's radio. The USCG located the accident site at 1156. At 1308 all 11 survivors had been hoisted into the USCG's rescue helicopter and transferred to the staging area for transport back to Ketchikan,. The accident site was located on a rock face on the east side of Jumbo Mountain at an elevation of about 2,557 ft msl. All the airplane major components were located at the accident site.Probable cause ""The pilot's decision to continue the visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain.""10-07-201810-07-201810-07-201810-07-2018",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2018

The aircraft experienced a pronounced pitch up during the takeoff roll, causing the underside of the rear fuselage to strike the runway. The takeoff was aborted and the aircraft taxied back to the stand. There were no personal injuries. The aircraft suffered serious local damage.Conclusions regarding factors related to the accident- During the start of take-off, the aircraft experienced an abrupt positive uncommanded pitch that caused the rear ventral area of the fuselage to contact the runway surface (tail strike). - The distribution of passengers on board the aircraft did not correspond to that established by the operational dispatch form prepared for the flight. - The CG position was in the range of 38% to 40% of MAC at takeoff. - The aircraft's CG was outside the flight envelope. - At the time of the accident, Flybondi hired the company FlySeg S.A. to perform the traffic and operational dispatch tasks at the Iguazú Falls International Airport. - The traffic personnel informed the dispatcher about the distribution of passengers on the aircraft through a series of photos taken at the check-in monitor which were sent by cell phone. - The Flybondi MOE did not include a specific procedure for the transmission of information between the traffic and operational dispatch areas. - The ARMS computer system used by dispatch was separate from the Radixx system used by traffic. - During the dispatch process, there was no visual control of the distribution of passengers, in disagreement with the Flybondi AOM. - It was not possible to determine the reasons for the discrepancy between the operational dispatch schedule and the actual distribution of passengers on board the aircraft. - The clearance of the dispatcher did not comply with RAAC 65. - The appointment of the chief cabin crew did not comply with the Flybondi AOM. - The cabin crew was unaware of the potential hazards associated with the distribution of passengers on the aircraft. - The investigation did not obtain records of a stopover clearance inspection of the Iguazu Falls International Airport prior to the start of operations on January 26, 2018. - From the start of operations until the day of the accident, ANAC conducted only one stopover inspection on June 29th. It only recorded that the dispatchers had not complied with the operational familiarization flight. - Between June and July 2018, the stopover accounted for a 425% increase in the number of movements, from 32 to 136 respectively. The accident flight corresponded to operation No. 70 in July. - Between June and July 2018, one operational dispatcher and one traffic agent were added to the scale, increasing the staff assigned to it from five to seven people (one base manager, two dispatchers and four traffic agents). - Since the beginning of the service, FlySeg S.A. did not receive any operational safety audits or inspections from Flybondi. - The service time performed by the dispatcher during the week prior to the accident was 60 hours, including a total of 39 hours between 1400 on July 13 and 200 on July 16. Three of the shifts performed in this period involved more than 10 consecutive hours of work. - The time of service performed by the dispatcher of flight FO5111 was not in compliance with the provisions of RAAC 121. - The RAACs do not establish service and rest time requirements for base managers and traffic personnel because they are not included as aeronautical personnel in the current regulations. - At the time of the accident, Flybondi was in the process of implementing phase 2 of the SMS.- Between January and July 2018 a total of three different people were in charge of the Flybondi GSO. During this period, the company went approximately two months without appointing an operational safety manager. - At the time of the accident, Flybondi did not have a program for voluntary safety reporting. - The investigation obtained no records of safety publications made by SMS prior to the accident. - At the time of the accident, Flybondi personnel had not received training on the ERP. - Current regulations do not establish operational safety training requirements for performing the duties of a base or traffic manager.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,JST ,2018

The aircraft came to rest in the grass next to the runway and burst into flames. The captain, crew chief, and 4 passengers sustained serious injuries, 1 passenger sustained minor injuries, and the co-pilot and 5 passengers were not injured.The aircraft was to be flown to a fly-in at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.The co-pilot, who was the flying pilot reported that prior to the flight, it was briefed that he would perform the takeoff. He stated that the captain taxied the airplane to the runup area, where all pre-takeoff checks were completed; the captain then taxied the airplane onto runway 19. The co-pilot further stated that he then took control of the airplane, provided a pre-takeoff brief, and initiated the takeoff sequence. About 10 seconds into the takeoff roll, the airplane drifted right, at which time he applied left rudder input. This was followed shortly by the captain saying that he had the airplane. The captain, who was the non-flying pilot, reported to the NTSB that during the initial stages of the takeoff roll, he didn't recall the airplane swerving to the right, however, recalled telling the co-pilot not to push the tail up because it was heavy; he also remembered the airplane swerving to the left shortly thereafter. The captain stated that he yelled ""right rudder"" three times before taking control of the airplane. He said that as he put his hands on the control yoke, he noticed that either the tail started to come down or the main wheels were either light or were just coming off the ground as it exited the left side of the runway. The captain said that he knew the airplane was slow as he tried to ease it over [to the runway] and set it back down. Subsequently, he felt the 'shutter of a stall,"" and the airplane turned to the left and impacted the ground. After the airplane came to a stop, a postimpact fire ensued, during which all the occupants of the airplane egressed through the aft left door. A video of the takeoff and accident sequence shows the aircraft accellerating on the runway, with the tailwheel leaving the ground very briefly. A few seconds after the tailwheel touched down again, the aircraft seems to drift off the left side of the runway. The aircraft banks right, causing the left hand main landing gear to become airborne. The right hand wing tip touched or almost touched the ground before the aircraft became airborne. The left wing dropped and the wing tip touched the ground, causing the plane to slew to the left and touch down again. The right hand main gear then seems to fold as the aircraft comes to rest in a cloud of dust.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane came to rest upright on a heading of about 113° magnetic, about 145 ft east of the left side, and 2,638 ft from the approach end of runway 19. The postimpact fire consumed the fuselage from the nose cone aft to about 3 ft forward of the left side cargo door along with a majority of the wing center section. No evidence of any flight control locks was found installed. The tailwheel locking pin was found in place and was sheered into multiple pieces. Vegetation (grass) within about 200 ft of the main wreckage was burnt from the postimpact fire. The wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further examination.21-07-201821-07-201820 Jan. 194543-49942USAAF30 Jan. 1945KN270Royal Air Force-RAF4 June 1946KN270Royal Canadian Air Force-RCAF26 June 197012909Canadian Armed Forces8 Jan. 1976C-GCKEOntario Central Airlines16 Jan. 1984C-GCKENunasi-Central Airlines16 Dec. 1985C-GCKEOntario Central Airlines21 Apr. 1986C-GCKEPerimeter Airlines Inland10 June 1986C-GCKEAta Construction Ltd.8 Dec. 1986C-GCKECalm Air1 June 1995C-GCKERandy Daoust27 Sep. 1995C-GCKESabourin Lake Airways24 Nov. 1998N595AMPatrick Q.

After the passengers had disembarked, the two pilots carried out post-flight checks and secured the aircraft. The aircraft remained on Stand 16 until the 22 July 2018 when the pilots returned to prepare the aircraft for a flight to Gander, Canada (CYQX).Prior to departure for CYQX, the flight crew carried out pre-flight checks of the exterior of the aircraft and cockpit setup, dividing the tasks between the two crew members. During this process the pilot installed the Torque Link Release Pin on the nose landing gear. This pin is used to connect the upper and lower torque links on the nose gear leg to allow nose gear steering. However, the torque links were not connected and the pin was inadvertently just installed on the upper torque link.When the six passengers arrived, they boarded promptly and final preparations for departure were completed. The aircraft taxied the short distance from Stand 16 to runway 16 using taxiway Alpha. While taxiing, the captain experienced some difficulties in turning the nose wheel. He discussed his concerns with the Second-In-Command (SIC) who confirmed that the relevant pre-flight inspection of the nose gear had been completed. Both pilots focussed on the location of the Torque Link Release Pin (i.e. ""the pin was in"") and did not discuss the status of the assembly (disconnected or connected).The aircraft turned onto the runway and began the take-off roll. At a groundspeed of 67 kts the captain aborted the take-off due to a significant vibration of the nose wheel. The maximum recorded ground speed was 74 kts, after which the aircraft decelerated and came to rest on runway 16, where it was attended by Cork Airport Fire Services (AFS). Once the AFS had inspected the aircraft, the passengers disembarked through the main cabin door onto runway 16. The nose gear leg and nose structure of the aircraft suffered significant damage. During the accident sequence, the lower part of the nose gear leg turned through approximately 90 degrees, both tyres burst and disintegrated, leading to significant wear on the hub of the forward wheel.Probable Cause 1. Pre-flight checks of the aircraft exterior did not identify that the torque link assembly was disconnected.Contributory Causes1. Absence of a visual warning on the torque link assembly to draw a pilots attention to an incorrectly installed Torque Link Release Pin.2. Absence of a design feature on the torque link assembly to prevent incorrect installation of the Torque Link Release Pin.3. The pre-flight check of the torque link assembly is merged with the checks for wheels and tires.4. Shallow cockpit gradient.5. The phraseology used in the aircraft Normal Checklist, pilot training and by pilots to describe the installation of the Torque Link Release Pin.6. The AMM erroneously stated that the lower torque link was spring-loaded and would extend horizontally from the nose strut when disconnected.22-07-2018",Executive,AAIU ,2018

There are said to have been seven persons on board the aircraft. The pilot and passenger survived the accident.The Antonov An-2 operated on a mixed cargo/passenger flight from Tshikapa to Kamako, Nsumbula, Diboko and back to Tshikapa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.After take-off from Kamako, climbing to 3500 feet, the pilot noticed a flock of birds. Some minutes later, he noticed that the engine was beginning to lose power. Thinking that he had flown through a group of birds, he decided to return to Kamako Airstrip.The elevation of the land in this area varies between 2000 and 2500 feet of altitude.Without engine power, he began to lose altitude on the right downwind leg of the approach. Being unable to reach the Kamako, the pilot steered into a valley between two hills. During the attempted forced landing the aircraft hit a tree canopy and fell to the ground, bursting into flames. The pilot and the passenger next to him escaped with minor injuries.ConclusionGiven all parameters, the only way the PIC thought of how to save the aircraft was to try to glide towards the valley between the hills. As the aircraft approached the ground, the canopy stopped its course and the aircraft fell and made sudden contact with the ground.The cabin was deformed and the passengers on board could not open the emergency door.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,BPEA DR Congo ,2018

All 103 occupants survived but 14 suffered serious injuries.The aircraft arrived at Durango from Mexico City as flight 2430 at 1411 hours local time, 23 minutes ahead of schedule. As the ERJ-190 was prepared for the return flight there was a broken layer of cumulonimbus clouds at 2500 feet. Airport weather information shows that a thunderstorm had developed by 1518 hours local time and the temperature had dropped from 28°C to 20°C over the previous hour.In the flight crew on board flight AM2431 consisted of a captain, co-pilot and an observer. The observer was a licensed commercial pilot with type rating for Beech King Air planes. He was in the process of obtaining a type rating for Embraer jets and had accumulated 64 hours of simulator time.The captain allowed the observer to take the right hand seat and the co-pilot occupied the jump seat. He also allowed the observer to act as Pilot Flying.The aircraft commenced the takeoff roll on runway 03 at 1522 hours local time (planned departure time was 1509 hours). During the takeoff roll there were notable variations in airspeed and wind direction. At 152242 hours, the aircraft was accelerating through an airspeed of 146 knots. Wind at that time was 47 degrees (from the right-hand side) at 33 knots. Eight seconds later the aircraft had rotated and was climbing through 8 feet radio altitude at an airspeed of 145 knots. By that time the wind had shifted to a crosswind 103 degrees at 11 knots. The aircraft reached a highest altitude of about 30 feet. At 152256 hours, the aircraft had descended to 19 feet and was caught in a 22-knot tailwind of 30 degrees.The aircraft then hit the ground to the left of the runway, left wing first. Both engines broke away during the subsequent ground slide. The aircraft came to rest about 380 meters past the runway threshold and 320 meters past the paved end of the runway, slightly to the left of the extended centreline.

The aircraft crashed into the western slope of Piz Segnas at an elevation of 2540 m. All 17 passengers and three crew members were killed.The aircraft had departed Locarno, Switzerland, at 1610 on a flight to it's home base at Dübendorf.The aircraft flew on a northeasterly course into the basin southwest of Piz Segnas. Towards the north end of the basin, it began a left turn, which developed into a descending spiral trajectory. A short time later, the aircraft collided with the ground almost vertically and at high speed.Following the crash, all Swiss Junkers Ju-52 aircraft were grounded. Ju-Air was allowed to restart operations on August 17 with the two remaining aircraft of the same type. Since there were no indications of general technical defects at this time, the FOCA had approved the resumption of flight operations in compliance with precautionary measures.On November 20, the Swiss TSB published an interim report. There was still no evidence that a serious technical problem led to the accident. The investigation of the wreck, however, revealed severe structural damage in the form of cracks and corrosion on the main spar, the supporting element of the aircraft wing, and other parts of the aircraft. This damage was hidden during normal inspections and maintenance and could only be determined from the debris. Since the two Ju-52 HB-HOP and HB-HOS stationed in Dübendorf correspond in age as well as in hours of operation to the crashed aircraft, the Swiss authorities temporarily grounded both aircraft for inspections.Direct causeThe accident is attributable to the fact that after losing control of the aircraft there was insufficient space to regain control, thus the aircraft collided with the terrain.The investigation identified the following direct causal factors of the accident- The flight crew piloted the aircraft in a very high-risk manner by navigating it into a narrow valley at low altitude and with no possibility of an alternative flight path.- The flight crew chose a dangerously low airspeed as regard to the flight path.Both factors meant that the turbulence which was to be expected in such circumstances was able to lead not only to a short-term stall with loss of control but also to an unrectifiable situation.Directly contributory factorsThe investigation identified the following factors as directly contributing to the accident- The flight crew was accustomed to not complying with recognised rules for safe flight operations and taking high risks.- The aircraft involved in the accident was operated with a centre of gravity position that was beyond the rear limit. This situation facilitated the loss of control.Systemic causeThe investigation identified the following systemic cause of the accident- The requirements for operating the aircraft in commercial air transport operations with regard to the legal basis applicable at the time of the accident were not met.Systemically contributory factorsThe investigation identified the following factors as systemically contributing to the accident- Due to the air operators inadequate working equipment, it was not possible to calculate the accurate mass and centre of gravity of its Ju 52 aircraft.- In particular, the air operators flight crews who were trained as Air Force pilots seemed to be accustomed to systematically failing to comply with generally recognised aviation rules and to taking high risks when flying Ju 52 aircraft.- The air operator failed to identify or prevent both the deficits and risks which occurred during operations and the frequent violation of rules by its flight crews.- Numerous incidents, including several serious incidents, were not reported to the competent bodies and authorities. This meant that they were unable to take measures to improve safety- The supervisory authority failed to some extent to identify the numerous operational shortcomings and risks or to take effective, corrective action.04-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-201804-08-20181 Oct. 1939A-702Swiss Air Force29 July 1985HB-HOTJu-Air",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,STSB Switzerland ,2018

As the aircraft was climbing through 10000 feet shortly after the departure from Vancouver, the flight crew heard a loud bang coming from the number 2 engine (Pratt & Whitney PW4060-3), associated with a power loss and abnormal engine indications. The number 2 engine was brought to idle, and a MAYDAY was declared. The flight subsequently returned to Vancouver where an overweight landing was executed with ARFF on standby. There were no injuries. Following the landing, the Vancouver Airport Authorities detected debris on runway 08R/26L, and closed it to clean it up.An initial visual inspection of the engine revealed extensive damage to the aft-most turbine blades.

The crew decided to cross the formation, assuming they would only experience light turbulence; however, the effect of the turbulence caused the aircraft to descend 5500 ft uncontrolled, in a few seconds, to an altitude of 5000 ft.The crew regained control, and landed without further problems at 1609. As a result of the event, one passenger suffered minor injuries. Due to the cumulonimbus crossing the aircraft suffered severe structural damage.The investigation determined that the probable cause of the accident was loss of situational awareness (SAW) and decision-making ability (ADM) on the part of the Commander, who failed to prevent the flight from crossing through a severe weather condition (cumulonimbus), despite having warned of this hazard and having been detected and clearly identified on the weather radar.As contributing factors were found- A reckless attitude of the crew in underestimating a clearly detected and recognized weather hazard and in boasting of their ability to fly through those conditions- Poor management of resources in the cockpit, by not using the right tools such as leadership, assertive communication and proper decision making based on risk assessment.- And, finally, complacency on the part of the First Officer as a Pilot Flying, who executed the Commander's orders without considering the risk or consequences of entering into known bad weather conditions.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,Aerocivil ,2018

The aircraft departed Beijing Airport at 0017 UTC (0817 LT), bound for Macau. Macau Tower controller reported the surface wind to the pilots as 7 knots at 220 degrees (4 knot tailwind and 6 knot crosswind) at 1 minute 25 seconds before touchdown. The ILS approach to runway 34 was continued as the tailwind component was within the company limits of 10 knots.The autopilot was disconnected at 370 feet Radio Altitude (RA). The aircraft then experienced an increasing tailwind component from 9 knots at 200 feet RA (airspeed 139 knots), to 27 knots at 5 feet RA (airspeed 119 knots). After this severe low-level wind shear encounter, the aircraft touched down on the main landing gear with a peak vertical acceleration 2.36G at about 350 metres after the threshold of runway 34. It bounced and touched down again four seconds later on the nose landing gear with peak vertical acceleration 3.41G at about 635 metres after the threshold of runway 34.

The first officer acted as the pilot flying (PF).Weather at Sochi was poor due to the presence of a thunderstorm in the area. After descending to FL90, the pilot contacted Sochi Radar, waited for the weather that met his minimum and was cleared for landing on runway 06.At 024411, when the aircraft was at 850 ft (about 260 m) and at distance of 5000 m from the threshold, the Predictive Windshear System Warning sounded ""Go around. Windshear ahead"". The crew ignored the wind shear warnings and continued to descend along the glide path. Upon passing the Decision Height of 627 ft (190 m), the PF did not verbalize a decision to continue or go around. The aircraft continued to descend. At 024509, at the altitude of about 170 ft (50 m) and at distance of 850 m from the runway threshold, the ""Windshear, Windshear, Windshear"" alert sounded in the cockpit. At an altitude of about 30 m visibility decreased because of heavy showers. The captain took over the controls and performed a go-around. The workload increased and the first officer forgot to raise the flaps from position 1 to fully up, despite stating this to the captain. Half a minute later he realised his mistake and proceeded to raise the flaps. While complaining about the weather, the crew encountered difficulties in engaging the autopilot but eventually succeeded.Starting 0249 the aircraft was hastily prepared for the second approach. The captain was now acting as PF for the approach. This time the aircraft was high and fast.At 025349, the controller informed the flight that a preceding aircraft had gone around. The first officer than contact the Tower controller and reported intercepting the glide slope at 600 m, despite the fact that the aircraft had not reached that altitude yet. Sochi Tower cleared the flight for the approach. At 025448, the flight was cleared to land on runway 06.At height of 1050 ft (320 m) at a distance of 6100 m from the runway, the aural warning ""Go around. Windshear ahead"" sounded, but the approach was continued.The flight crew failed to verbally confirm that the approach was stabilized, with the captain simply stating ""...to minimum."" In fact the approach was not stabilized given the variation in airspeed.The first officer called out speeds and altitudes continuously in a rather tense voice. During the approach the autopilot and autothrust were engaged.At 025642, at height of about 470 ft (145 m) and distance of 2650 m to the runway, the chime sound and three-time aural warning ""Windshear, Windshear, Windshear"" sounded. However, the crew, in spite of these warnings, continued to descend.At 025713, at height of 75 ft (25 m) and distance of 150 m to the threshold, the captain had disengaged the autopilot and autothrottle, and took manual control. At this time, the aircraft was in the center of the wind shear. Exactly before that, the autothrottle started to reduce the engine rotation speed as the instrument speed to this moment had reached the value of 170 kts. When the autothrottle was disengaged, the throttles remained in this setting. It resulted in the instrument speed increase up to 173 kts. The aircraft passed over the threshold at height of about 54 ft (15 m) and touched down about 1285 m from the threshold at an instrument speed of 160 kts. Right after the aircraft had landed the spoilers were extended automatically and autobrake was initiated. The first officer reported ""Speedbrake up, Reversers maximum"", but the reversers were not yet engaged. The captain noticed this 20 seconds after touchdown and immediately ordered them to be deployed. The engines however were already at ground idle, and when the engines reached maximum reverse mode the aircraft had already overrun the runway.At 025754, 26 seconds after touchdown, the aircraft overran the runway with a ground speed of about 75 kts, broke through the aerodrome fencing and came to rest on a dry and rocky surface in a river bed. Eighteen passengers were injured. The aircraft sustained serious damage.The aircraft overrun, destroying and damage by fire were caused by the following factors- repeated disregarding of the windshear warnings which when entered a horizontal windshear (changing from the head wind to tail one) at low altitude resulted in landing at distance of 1285 m from the RWY threshold (overrunning the landing zone by 385 m) with the increased IAS and tail wind;- landing to the runway, when its normative friction coefficient was less than 0.3 that according to the regulations in force, did not allow to land.The factors contributed the accident- the crew violation of the AFM and Operator's OM requirements in regards to the actions required a forecasted or actual wind shear warning;- use of the automatic flight mode (autopilot, autothrottle) in the flight under the windshear conditions which resulted in the aircraft being unstable (excess thrust) when turning to the manual control;- lack of prevention measures taken by the Operator when the previous cases of poor crew response to windshear warning were found;- insufficient crew training in regards to CRM and TEM that did not allow to identify committed mistakes and/or violations in good time;- the crew members' high psychoemotional state caused by inconsistency between the actual landing conditions and the received training as well as the psychological limit which was determined by the individual psychological constitution of each member;- insufficient braking both in auto and manual mode during the aircraft rollout caused by the insufficient tyre-to-ground friction aiming to achieve the specified rate of braking.Most probably the insufficient tyre-to-ground friction was caused by the significant amount of water on the RWY surface;- the aerodrome services' noncompliance of Sochi International Aerodrome Manual requirements related to the RWY after heavy showers inspection which resulted in the crew provision of wrong normative friction coefficients.In obtaining of the increased overrun speed of about 75 kt (140 km/h) the later setting of engines into reverse mode was contributed (the engines were set into reverse mode 16 s later than the aircraft landed at distance of about about 200 m from the runway end)01-09-201801-09-201830 Oct. 2002EI-CTBBoeing19 Nov. 2002EI-CTBRyanair14 March 2009EI-CTBRyanair13 May 2010VQ-BDUAtlant-Soyuz Airlines1 Nov. 2010VQ-BDUMoscow Airlines19 Jan. 2011VQ-BDUMoscow Airlines7 Oct. 2011VQ-BJIUTAir",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2018

The aircraft was modified for geophysical survey work and converted to a Texas Turbine Conversions Supervan 900 using an 850 hp Honeywell TPE331-12JR engine (as opposed to the standard 675 hp PT6A-114A engine), and a 4-bladed prop. It was to be ferried from Jandakot Airport, Australia, to Greenwood, Mississippi, USA. After departing Jandakot on September 15, stops were made at Alice Springs, Weipa and Horn Island in Australia. It then continued to Guam and Saipan. At Saipan the pilot detected damage to the propeller anti-ice boot. The aircraft was delayed for more than a week while a company engineer travelled to Saipan and replaced the anti-ice boot.The plane took off from Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, USA at ca. 0700 Japan Standard Time (JST) for the next ferry leg to New Chitose, Japan with estimated flight time of 9 hours. About an hour after departure, the aircraft levelled out at flight level FL220.Though the position report at 1023 JST was normally established, the next report planned at 1144 JST was not received by the Japanese ATC. Two F-4's of Japan Air Self-Defense Force noticed the aircraft flying normally at 1450 JST over the Pacific Ocean, but could not establish any radio contact with the flight. The JASDF pilots were unable to see into the cockpit to determine whether the pilot was in his seat or whether there was any indication that he was incapacitated.After about 30 minutes, the JASDF pilots observed the aircraft descend into cloud. The aircraft descended rapidly and disappeared from radar less than 2 minutes later. Within 2 hours, search and rescue personnel located the aircrafts rear passenger door. No other aircraft parts were located and the pilot was not found.The ATSB concluded that while the aircraft was in the cruise on autopilot, the pilot almost certainly became incapacitated and did not recover. About 5 hours after the last position report, without pilot intervention to select fuel tanks, the aircrafts engine stopped, likely due to fuel starvation. This resulted in the aircraft entering an uncontrolled descent into the ocean.The cause of incapacitation could not be determined. While a medical event could not be ruled out, the pilot was operating alone in an unpressurised aircraft at 22,000 ft and probably using an unsuitable oxygen system, which increased the risk of experiencing hypoxia and being unable to recover.Contributing factors- During the cruise between Saipan and New Chitose, the pilot very likely became incapacitated and could no longer operate the aircraft.- The aircrafts engine most likely stopped due to fuel starvation from pilot inaction, which resulted in the aircraft entering an uncontrolled descent into the ocean.27-09-2018",Ferry/positioning,ATSB ,2018
28-SEP-2018,Boeing 737-8BK (WL),P2-PXE,Air Niugini,1,near Chuuk/Weno I...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20180928-0,Approach (APR),Substantial,Landing after unstabilized approach Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) - Water,"A Boeing 737-800 operated by Air Niugini as flight 73 impacted the water of Chuuk Lagoon about 1,500 ft (460 m) short of the runway 04 threshold, during its approach Chuuk International Airport, Micronesia. The aircraft took off from Pohnpei at 2222 on a flight to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea via Chuuk. The PIC was the pilot flying for the sector to Chuuk. The copilot was the monitoring pilot. The engineer for the flight was seated in the cockpit jump seat during the approach. Prior to top of descent the crew briefly discussed brake setting for the landing and discussed the approach and landing flap setting. They agreed to select Flap 40. They then discussed the approach and missed approach procedure they would conduct at HAMAX if they found themselves not visual by that point. However, the approach and landing checklist and the briefing on the RNAV approach chart briefings were not conducted in accordance with the SOPs and not using standard phraseology. At top of descent, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were already high and needed to immediately initiate their descent. The crew commenced their descent leaving FL400 at 2256, at a descent rate of 944 ft/pm. At FL340, the copilot contacted San Francisco radio and reported that they were maintaining FL340. Both pilots discussed the descent clearance for about two minutes, trying to recall and clarify the instructions that they were given. At 2305, while maintaining FL340, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were high on profile and needed to descend to get back on the required descent profile. At 2308, the PIC said ""alright, we catching back on profile, so just keep the speed up"". The copilot contacted Chuuk radio at 2308 and requested a weather update. At 2311, Chuuk radio contacted the crew with the weather update for Chuuk stating ""wind variable at 5, visibility 14 scattered 012 charlie bravo, broken 120 overcast 280, temperature 26 dep point 25, altimeter 2973"". At 2315, at about 15 nm from Chuuk while passing 8,600 ft, the copilot made an inbound broadcast call stating their intention to track for the RNAV (GPS) runway 04, from the east south-east. Five minutes later the copilot made a general broadcast, stating that they were established on 041 inbound via the RNAV (GPS) runway 04. The aircraft was then configured for the approach. At 1000 feet the aircraft was stable but above the 3 degrees glidepath. At 2323 the PIC disconnected the auto-pilot and stated ""Im going back on profile."" When passing 548 ft (602 ft Radio Altitude) on descent, the aircraft entered the storm cell and heavy rain and the PIC called for the wipers to be switched on. After passing the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA), between 307 ft (364 ft RA) fourteen 'Sink Rate' and 'Glideslope' aural alerts began to sound. The flight crew disregarded the alerts, and did not acknowledge the ""minimums"" and 100 ft alerts. After descending through 100 feet the copilot noticed they were dangerously low and called rapidly with high intonation ""Too low! Were too low! Were too low! Were too low!"" The aircraft then skipped across the water several times before it settled in the water and turned clockwise through 210 deg and drifted 460 ft (140 m) south east of the runway 04 extended centreline, with the nose of the aircraft pointing about 265 degrees. Local boaters rescued 28 passengers and two cabin crew from the left over-wing exits. Two cabin crew, the two pilots and the engineer were rescued by local boaters from the forward door 1L. One life raft was launched from the left aft over-wing exit by cabin crew CC5 with the assistance of a passenger. The US Navy divers rescued six passengers and four cabin crew and the Load Master from the right aft over-wing exit. All injured passengers were evacuated from the left over-wing exits. One passenger was fatally injured, and local divers located his body in the aircraft three days after the accident. The accident investigators concluded that both pilots were not situationally aware during the approach and did not recognise the developing significant unsafe condition after passing the Missed Approach Point (MAP) when the aircraft entered a storm cell and heavy rain. The weather radar on the PICs Navigation Display showed a large red area indicating a storm cell immediately after the MAP, between the MAP and the runway. The copilot as the monitoring pilot was ineffective and was oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. He did not recognise the significant unsafe condition and therefore did not realise the need to challenge the PIC and take control of the aircraft, as required by the Air Niugini SOP. Training records showed that the copilot had been checked in the simulator for EGPWS Alert (Terrain) however there was no evidence of simulator check sessions covering the vital actions and responses required to retrieve a perceived or real situation that might compromise the safe operation of the aircraft. Specifically sustained unstabilised approach below 1,000 ft amsl in IMC as in the case of the accident. The PIC did not conduct the missed approach at the MAP despite the criteria required for visually continuing the approach not being met, including visually acquiring the runway or the PAPI. The PIC did not conduct a go around after passing the MAP and subsequently the MDA although the aircraft had entered IMC; the approach was unstable; the glideslope indicator on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) was showing a rapid glideslope deviation from a half-dot low to 2-dots high within 9 seconds after passing the MDA; the rate of descent was high (more than 1,000 ft/min) and increasing; there were EGPWS Sink Rate and Glideslope aural alerts; and the EGPWS visual PULL UP warning message was displayed on the PFD.CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS]The flight crew did not comply with Air Niugini Standard Operating Procedures Manual (SOPM) and the approach and pre-landing checklists. The RNAV (GPS) Rwy 04 Approach chart procedure was not adequately briefed.The aircrafts flight path became unstable with lateral over-controlling commencing shortly after autopilot disconnect at 625 ft (677 ft). From 546 ft (600 ft) the aircraft was flown in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and the rate of descent significantly exceeded 1,000 feet/min in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) from 420 ft (477 ft).The flight crew heard, but disregarded, 13 EGPWS aural alerts (Glideslope and Sink Rate), and flew a 4.5º average flight path (glideslope).The pilots lost situational awareness and their attention was channelised or fixated on completing the landing.The PIC did not execute the missed approach at the MAP despite PAPI showing 3 whites just before entering IMC; the unstabilised approach; the glideslope indicator on the PFD showing a rapid glideslope deviation from half-dot low to 2-dots high within 9 seconds after passing the MDA; the excessive rate of descent; the EGPWS aural alerts and the EGPWS visual PULL UP warning on the PFD.The copilot (support/monitoring pilot) was ineffective and was oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation.It is likely that a continuous ""WHOOP WHOOP PULL UP"" hard aural warning, simultaneously with the visual display of PULL UP on the PFD (desirably a flashing visual display PULL UP on the PFD), could have been effective in alerting the crew of the imminent danger, prompting a pull up and execution of a missed approach, that may have prevented the accident.28-09-201828-09-20181 April 2005VT-AXCBoeing19 April 2005VT-AXCAir India Express6 July 2007VT-AXCAir India Express29 July 2010VT-JBTJet Airways24 July 2013M-ABGKCIT Leasing Corporation13 Sept. 2013P2-PXEAir Niugini12 May 2018P2-PXEAir Niugini4 July 2018P2-PXEAir Niugini",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2018

Runway 23L was available for landing only with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 2248 meters. Additionaly, the touchdown zone lights of runway 23L and runway centreline lights were unserviceable.Flight 414 touched down on runway 23L following an NDB approach. Wind was reported to be from 060° at 2 m/s, resulting in a 4 knot tailwind component. A runway friction coefficient of 0.45 was communicated to the flight. The aircraft failed to stop on the remaining runway and overran onto the area that was under reconstruction, stopping after 250 meters. This caused damage to the forward fuselage, separation of both main landing gear bogies and a fuel tank leak.After the accident, a measurement showed friction coefficients of 0.25, 0.32, and 0.25 on the runway. The aircraft was dispatched with a deactivated thrust reverser on engine no.2. According to the limitations of the minimum equipment list (MEL), landing with deactivated engine reversers is allowed at a friction coefficient of not less than 0.4.ConclusionThe cause of the aviation accident with the RRJ 95B RA-89011 aircraft when landing at night with one deactivated thrust reverser was the transfer to the crew of incorrect information about the value of the friction coefficient, which led to the landing on an icy runway, the average normative friction coefficient which was less than 0.3, which did not allow landing in accordance with current regulations. This led to a significant increase in landing distance, rolling the aircraft out of the runway and collision with the junction of the reconstructed section of the runway with a height of about 0.4 m, which led to the destruction of the main landing gear supports and damage to the engines with fuel leakage without causing a fire.The contributing factors were the following- Absence of a connecting ramp (which was not envisaged by the reconstruction project) between the current and the part of the runway being reconstructed;- inefficiency of the SMS of Yakutsk Airport JSC in terms of identification and control of risks associated with the possibility of ice formation at the runway, and insufficient control over the implementation of the SMS by aviation authorities;- erroneous determination of the Xc value at the last measurement;- inefficiency of ice removal procedure during runway cleaning due to lack of chemical reagents for ice removal and/or thermal machines at the airfield;- lack of information from the RRJ-95LR-100 RA 89038 aircraft crew about actual rolling out of the runway, which was an aviation incident and was subject to investigation;- failure by airport and ATC officials to take appropriate action after receiving the RRJ-95LR-100 RA-89038 low friction report from the aircraft crew.10-10-201810-10-201810-10-201810-10-2018",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2018

The aircraft was operating a regular flight to Dubai. It was cleared for takeoff from runway 27 at 0118 local time. As the aircraft accelerated through a speed of 117 knots, the captain's seat recliner mechanism failed. As the captain became unsettled, the throttle levers and control column were moved back inadvertently. He handed over control to the co-pilot for five seconds.After adjusting his seat the captain took control back from the co-pilot and the take off was continued.Both crew members failed to notice drop in engine thrust from 98% to 77%. And since the Auto Throttle was in Throttle Hold mode above 84 kts, the thrust remained at 77%.At 144 knots, some 2000 feet short of the runway end, the captain raised the nose of the aircraft for rotation. he noticed a slower rotation rate and that a higher control column force was required than normal. He increased the control column force aft in order to get airborne. This caused a higher rotation rate and a pitch angle of 10.7 degrees which lead to tail strike on the undulated soft surface past the end of the runway for 17 meters followed by the aft fuselage contacting the localizer antenna and boundary wall. Both main landing gears also impacted the brick boundary wall, causing two holes. The aircraft climbed to FL360 and proceeded towards Dubai because all systems were normal. While en route the operations department insisted upon a diversion to Mumbai. At that time the flight was well over the Arabian Sea. The aircraft landed safely at Mumbai at 0538 local time.PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT Delayed take-off due to reduction of take-off thrust N1 from 98 % to 77 % before reaching V1, inability of both the crew members to monitor the thrust parameters and to take timely corrective action. This resulted in tail strike and subsequent hitting of the localizer Antenna and boundary wall of the airport.Contributory factors- PIC seatback recliner mechanism failure during take-off roll.- Breakdown of Crew coordination during switching between PF, PM and back.- Loss of situational awareness12-10-2018",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2018

The Aircraft Flight Maintenance Log (AFML) recorded that since October 26, 2018 until the occurrence date several problems occurred related to airspeed and altitude flags that appeared on the captain's (left) Primary Flight Display (PFD) on three occasions, SPEED TRIM FAIL light illumination and MACH TRIM FAIL light illumination that occurred twice.Several attempts were made by engineers to rectify these issues. The day before the accident the Angle of Attack (AoA) sensor was replaced by engineers at Denpasar Airport.The flight from Denpasar to Jakarta (JT43) was the flight prior to JT610. During rotation of flight JT43, the stick shaker activated and an IAS DISAGREE warning showed on the captain's PFD at 400 feet. The flight was handled by the copilot as it was determined that the captain's PFD was unreliable. The flight crew moved the STAB TRIM (stabilizer trim) switch to CUT OUT due to three automatic nosedown trim occurrences. The crew worked checklists and continued the flight to CGK.Based on the crew's entry in the AFML, the engineer at Jakarta flushed the left Pitot Air Data Module (ADM) and static ADM to rectify the reported IAS and ALT disagree and cleaned the electrical connector plug of the elevator feel computer. The aircraft was subsequently released to carry out flight JT610.During takeoff from Jakarta, the DFDR recorded a difference between left and right Angle of Attack of about 20° which continued until the end of the recording. During rotation of the aircraft, the left control column stick shaker activated and continued for most of the flight.After the flaps were retracted, the FDR recorded automatic aircraft nose down (AND) trim for 10 seconds followed by flight crew commanded aircraft nose up (ANU) trim. Automatic AND trim briefly stopped when the flaps were temporarily extended to 5.In their communications with air traffic control, the flight crew asked the controller to confirm the altitude of the aircraft and later also asked the speed as shown on the controller radar display. The copilot reported experiencing a ""flight control problem"" and that they were flying the aircraft manually.Last radio contact was at 0631 local time when the captain requested the arrival controller to block altitude 3,000 feet above and below for traffic avoidance. The controller asked what altitude the pilot wanted, to which the captain responded ""five thou"". The controller approved the pilot request. The FDR stopped recording within twenty seconds of the pilot's response.The aircraft impacted the sea some 15 km north off Tanjung Bungin. All 189 persons on board died in the accident. Search and rescue personnel recovered the flight data recorder (FDR) and other debris on November 1, at 30-35 m below the water surface. In the initial stages of the investigation, it was found that there is a potential for repeated automatic nose-down trim commands of the horizontal stabilizer when the flight control system on a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft receives an erroneously high single AOA sensor input. Such a specific condition could among others potentially result in the stick shaker activating on the affected side and IAS, ALT and/or AOA DISAGREE alerts.The logic behind the automatic nosedown trim lies in the aircraft's MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that was introduced by Boeing on the MAX series aircraft. This feature was added to prevent the aircraft from entering a stall under specific conditions.On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) directing operators to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an AOA sensor. On November 7, the FAA issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring ""revising certificate limitations and operating procedures of the airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures to follow under certain conditions.""Contributing Factors1. During the design and certification of the Boeing 737-8 (MAX), assumptions were made about flight crew response to malfunctions which, even though consistent with current industry guidelines, turned out to be incorrect.2. Based on the incorrect assumptions about flight crew response and an incomplete review of associated multiple flight deck effects, MCASs reliance on a single sensor was deemed appropriate and met all certification requirements.3. MCAS was designed to rely on a single AOA sensor, making it vulnerable to erroneous input from that sensor.4. The absence of guidance on MCAS or more detailed use of trim in the flight manuals and in flight crew training, made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond to uncommanded MCAS.5. The AOA DISAGREE alert was not correctly enabled during Boeing 737-8 (MAX) development. As a result, it did not appear during flight with the mis-calibrated AOA sensor, could not be documented by the flight crew and was therefore not available to help maintenance identify the mis-calibrated AOA sensor.6. The replacement AOA sensor that was installed on the accident aircraft had been mis-calibrated during an earlier repair. This mis-calibration was not detected during the repair.7. The investigation could not determine that the installation test of the AOA sensor was performed properly. The mis-calibration was not detected.8. Lack of documentation in the aircraft flight and maintenance log about the continuous stick shaker and use of the Runaway Stabilizer NNC meant that information was not available to the maintenance crew in Jakarta nor was it available to the accident crew, making it more difficult for each to take the appropriate actions.9. The multiple alerts, repetitive MCAS activations, and distractions related to numerous ATC communications were not able to be effectively managed. This was caused by the difficulty of the situation and performance in manual handling, NNC execution, and flight crew communication, leading to ineffective CRM application and workload management. These performances had previously been identified during training and reappeared during the accident flight.29-10-201829-10-201829-10-201829-10-201829-10-201829-10-201830 July 2018N1786BBoeing13 August 2018PK-LQPLion Air18 August 2018PK-LQPLion Air",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSC Indonesia ,2018

F-GZCI was standing on taxiway RT1 behind an Airbus A320 at the holding point for runway 08L. N817NW taxied towards the parallel runways on the North side and attempted to pass behind on taxiway R. The captain of N817NW initially stopped behind flight F-GZCI, but judged that the margin was sufficient to pass. The left winglet of N817NW damaged the tail cone and horizontal stabilizer of F-GZCI. The Air France crew interpreted the jolt as a consequence of jet blast from the Airbus A320 in front of them. The aircraft taxied forward after the A320 had entered the runway.  The first officer of the Delta flight contacted their operations department to inform them of a collision with another aircraft which had damaged their left wingtip and that they needed to return to the parking area. About three minutes after the collision, a towing agent radioed the SW ground controller that the Air France flight had damage on the underside of the tail. The Air France A330, still  waiting for clearance to taxi onto runway 08L, was then warned by the Tower controller about the damage.Both flights were then cancelled.CONCLUSIONWhile taxiing, the crew of flight DAL97 identified a possible conflict with flight AFR498 at a standstill on a perpendicular taxiway. After stopping before the junction and considering that they had enough of a margin, the crew started taxiing again.The left wingtip of the Delta Air Lines aeroplane then came into contact with the tail of the Air France aeroplane.The crew of flight DAL97 were aware of the collision with the Air France aeroplane (impact, then information about the collision via a call from the cabin). The FO in charge of radiocommunications reported the collision with another aeroplane to Deltas operations but simply confirmed the damage to his aeroplane to the air traffic controller, without mentioning the collision with the Air France aeroplane. This may be explained by the increased work load following the collision.The interpretation by the crew of flight AFR498, of the weak signals received (impact, then cabin call) meant that they did not realise that there had been a collision with another aeroplane.Only the intervention on the frequency of an agent towing another aeroplane, to advise of the damage to the Delta Air Lines aeroplane and then to the Air France aeroplane finally allowed the air traffic controller to identify the actors of the collision and to thus prevent flight AFR498 from taking off.When at least one of the crews involved in a collision between two aircraft is aware of the accident, its immediate declaration to the air traffic control service will ensure that the latter is aware of the complete situation, can rapidly identify the actors of the collision and prevent an additional accident.Whats more, this event is a reminder that precisely following the centre line of a taxiway does not protect an aircraft from colliding with other moving vehicles on taxiways which are not parallel to it.",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2018

The captain of N817NW initially stopped behind flight F-GZCI, but judged that the margin was sufficient to pass. The left winglet of N817NW damaged the tail cone and horizontal stabilizer of F-GZCI. The Air France crew interpreted the jolt as a consequence of jet blast from the Airbus A320 in front of them. The aircraft taxied forward after the A320 had entered the runway.  The first officer of the Delta flight contacted their operations department to inform them of a collision with another aircraft which had damaged their left wingtip and that they needed to return to the parking area. About three minutes after the collision, a towing agent radioed the SW ground controller that the Air France flight had damage on the underside of the tail. The Air France A330, still  waiting for clearance to taxi onto runway 08L, was then warned by the Tower controller about the damage.Both flights were then cancelled.CONCLUSIONWhile taxiing, the crew of flight DAL97 identified a possible conflict with flight AFR498 at a standstill on a perpendicular taxiway. After stopping before the junction and considering that they had enough of a margin, the crew started taxiing again.The left wingtip of the Delta Air Lines aeroplane then came into contact with the tail of the Air France aeroplane.The crew of flight DAL97 were aware of the collision with the Air France aeroplane (impact, then information about the collision via a call from the cabin). The FO in charge of radiocommunications reported the collision with another aeroplane to Deltas operations but simply confirmed the damage to his aeroplane to the air traffic controller, without mentioning the collision with the Air France aeroplane. This may be explained by the increased work load following the collision.The interpretation by the crew of flight AFR498, of the weak signals received (impact, then cabin call) meant that they did not realise that there had been a collision with another aeroplane.Only the intervention on the frequency of an agent towing another aeroplane, to advise of the damage to the Delta Air Lines aeroplane and then to the Air France aeroplane finally allowed the air traffic controller to identify the actors of the collision and to thus prevent flight AFR498 from taking off.When at least one of the crews involved in a collision between two aircraft is aware of the accident, its immediate declaration to the air traffic control service will ensure that the latter is aware of the complete situation, can rapidly identify the actors of the collision and prevent an additional accident.Whats more, this event is a reminder that precisely following the centre line of a taxiway does not protect an aircraft from colliding with other moving vehicles on taxiways which are not parallel to it.",International Scheduled Passenger,BEA ,2018
07-NOV-2018,Boeing 747-412F,N908AR,Sky Lease Cargo,0,Halifax-Stan...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20181107-0,Landing (LDG),Substantial,Insufficient rest / fatigue Runway excursion,"Sky Lease flight 4854, a Boeing 747-400F, suffered a runway excursion after landing at Halifax International Airport, Canada. The aircraft departed Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, USA at 0702 UTC (0102 local time) and arrived near Halifax about 0900 UTC (0500 local time). The controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 14.During the approach, the tower controller reported wind from 260° at 16 knots, gusting to 21 and asked the flight if runway 14 was still acceptable. Runway 14 is a 2347m long asphalt runway and the 16 knot wind from 26° would translate to an 8 knot tailwind component. When the aircraft was 1 minute and 21 seconds from the threshold, the crew realized the tailwind component; however, they did not recalculate the performance data to confirm that the landing distance available was still acceptable, likely because of the limited amount of time available before landing. The unexpected tailwind resulted in a greater landing distance required , but this distance did not exceed the length of the runway.After receiving a confirmation from the flight, the controller issued a clearence to land on runway 14.  The aircraft touched down firmly at approximately 0506, during the hours of darkness. After the firm touchdown, for undetermined reasons, the engine No. 1 thrust lever was moved forward of the idle position, causing the speed brakes to retract and the autobrake system to disengage, increasing the distance required to bring the aircraft to a stop. In addition, the right crab angle (4.5°) on initial touchdown, combined with the crosswind component and asymmetric reverser selection, caused the aircraft to deviate to the right of the runway centreline.During the landing roll, the pilot monitorings attention was focused on the lateral drift and, as a result, the required callouts regarding the position of the deceleration devices were not made.Although manual brake application began 8 seconds after touchdown, maximum braking effort did not occur until 15 seconds later, when the aircraft was 800 feet from the end of the runway. At this position, it was not possible for the aircraft to stop on the runway and, 5 seconds later, the aircraft departed the end of the runway at a speed of 77 knots and came to a stop 270 m (885 feet) past the end.The aircraft struck the approach light stanchions and the localizer antenna array. The No. 2 engine detached from its pylon during the impact sequence and came to rest under the left horizontal stabilizer, causing a fire in the tail section following the impact. The emergency locator transmitter activated. Aircraft rescue and firefighting personnel responded. All 3 crew members received minor injuries and were taken to the hospital. The passenger was not injured.During the overrun, the aircraft crossed a significant drop of 2.8 m (9 feet) approximately 166 m (544 feet) past the end of the runway and was damaged beyond repair.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The ineffective presentation style and sequence of the NOTAMs available to the crew and flight dispatch led them to interpret that Runway 23 was not available for landing at Halifax/Stanfield International Airport.2. The crew was unaware that the aircraft did not meet the pre-departure landing weight requirements using flaps 25 for Runway 14.3. Due to the timing of the flight during the nighttime circadian trough and because the crew had had insufficient restorative sleep in the previous 24 hours, the crew was experiencing sleep-related fatigue that degraded their performance and cognitive functioning during the approach and landing.4. Using unfactored (actual) landing distance charts may have given the crew the impression that landing on Runway 14 would have had a considerable runway safety margin, influencing their decision to continue the landing in the presence of a tailwind.5. When planning the approach, the crew calculated a faster approach speed of reference speed + 10 knots instead of the recommended reference speed + 5 knots, because they misinterpreted that a wind additive was required for the existing conditions.6. New information regarding a change of active runway was not communicated by air traffic control directly to the crew, although it was contained within the automatic terminal information service broadcast; as a result, the crew continued to believe that the approach and landing to Runway 14 was the only option available.7. For the approach, the crew selected the typical flap setting of flaps 25 rather than flaps 30, because they believed they had a sufficient safety margin. This setting increased the landing distance required by 494 feet.8. The crew were operating in a cognitive context of fatigue and biases that encouraged anchoring to and confirming information that aligned with continuing the initial plan, increasing the likelihood that they would continue the approach.9. The crew recognized the presence of a tailwind on approach 1 minute and 21 seconds from the threshold; likely due to this limited amount of time, the crew did not recalculate the performance data to confirm that the runway safety margin was still acceptable.10. An elevated level of stress and workload on short final approach likely exacerbated the performance-impairing effects of fatigue to limit the crews ability to determine the effect of the tailwind, influencing their decision to continue the approach.11. The higher aircraft approach speed, the presence of a tailwind component, and the slight deviation above the glideslope increased the landing distance required to a distance greater than the runway length available.12. After the firm touchdown, for undetermined reasons, the engine No. 1 thrust lever was moved forward of the idle position, causing the speed brakes to retract and the autobrake system to disengage, increasing the distance required to bring the aircraft to a stop.13. The right crab angle (4.5°) on initial touchdown, combined with the crosswind component and asymmetric reverser selection, caused the aircraft to deviate to the right of the runway centreline.14. During the landing roll, the pilot monitorings attention was focused on the lateral drift and, as a result, the required callouts regarding the position of the deceleration devices were not made.15. The pilot flying focused on controlling the lateral deviation and, without the benefit of the landing rollout callouts, did not recognize that all of the deceleration devices were not fully deployed and that the autobrake was disengaged.16. Although manual brake application began 8 seconds after touchdown, maximum braking effort did not occur until 15 seconds later, when the aircraft was 800 feet from the end of the runway. At this position, it was not possible for the aircraft to stop on the runway and, 5 seconds later, the aircraft departed the end of the runway at a speed of 77 knots and came to a stop 270 m (885 feet) past the end of the runway.17. During the overrun, the aircraft crossed a significant drop of 2.8 m (9 feet) approximately 166 m (544 feet) past the end of the runway and was damaged beyond repair. While this uneven terrain was beyond the 150 m (492 feet) runway end safety area proposed by Transport Canada, it was within the recommended International Civil Aviation Organization runway end safety area of 300 m (984 feet).07-11-201807-11-201807-11-201807-11-201807-11-201807-11-201807-11-201828 Feb. 19979V-SFFBoeing13 March 19979V-SFFSingapore Airlines Cargo1 May 2017N908ARSky Lease Cargo",Cargo,TSB Canada ,2018

The aircraft had arrived at Lisbon on October 2, 2018, to undergo maintenance at the OGMA facilities, located at the Alverca Air Base. The heavy maintenance consisted of a basic C2-Check, including complex modifications through the accomplishment of several service bulletins (SB), requiring modular avionics unit removal and installation, some additional work requested by the operator and the discrepancies correction.On October 9, a service bulletin (SB190-57-0038R2) was initiated, which changed the type of routing of the ailerons' control cables, with the replacement of pulleys and respective structural supports by a non-contact support, aiming to reduce the control cable friction on that area. Another service bulletin, SB190-27-0037R1 was accomplished, which consisted of replacing the installed stainless-steel control cables by carbon steel cables. Other maintenance works were also carried out on the aileron control cable system, such as lubrication, adjustments and tests.On October 26 and following the operational tests after aircraft power-up, a message appeared in the engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) that the aircraft could not be dispatched for flight due to problems related with the flight control system (FLT CTR NO DISPATCH).The maintenance work lasted until October 31st, during this time several tests were performed on the aircraft, including engines run-up and the aircraft final inspection, which included the flight control tests. However, the maintenance personnel did not identify the inversion of the aileron control cables during this late operational check, even though the maintenance instructions required them to confirm the correct surface deflections with control wheel inputs.Again, the FLT CTR NO DISPATCH error message appeared on the EICAS. The area manager allocated a small team to the aircraft in order to carry out the investigation of the anomaly.The maintenance organization began to suffer from internal and external pressures for aircraft delivery and return to service, especially since the original scheduled delivery date had been postponed by a week from October 24. The operator tried to assist and after a period of troubleshooting, which ran until November 11th, involving all AMO operational areas, operator and Embraer, the aircraft was released for return to service by the. The aircraft was prepared and positioned for the operators delivery crew that was waiting for the maintenance work completion and documentation delivery.After some new discrepancies had been resolved, the aircraft was ready to depart. Flight KC1388 was the first post-maintenance flight. The aircraft was to be ferried back to the operator base at Almaty, Kazakhstan, with a refueling stop-over at Minsk, Belarus. On board were a captain, two copilots, and three technicians. The aircraft took off at 1331 hours with the captain as Pilot Flying. Immediately after take-off, with adverse meteorological conditions, the crew felt that the aircraft was not responding adequately to the commands, developing oscillatory wing movements. The crew, using all the aircraft control resources for its three axis, immediately tried to counter the movements, however without understanding the cause for the flight instability and without being able to engage the autopilot. Realising that they were without effective control of the aircraft, only being able  with considerable effort  to minimize the oscillatory movements, with high structural loads involved during some recovery manoeuvres and using crossed commands. The crew immediately declared emergency while trying to diagnose the cause for the abnormal roll of the aircraft, continuing to struggle to gain its control, having no malfunction indication from the aircraft systems, just the continuous alerts for abnormal flight attitudes and autopilot system (AP FAIL) fault information. The flight requested to return to Alverca. About 1337 the flight requested to climb to FL100, again stating they had ""flight control problems"". The situation did not improve, and the performed trajectories caused the aircraft and the persons on board to sustain intense G-forces, and causing the aircraft complete loss of control for some moments at multiple instances. Considering the situation criticality, the crew requested several times for headings in order to be able to reach the sea for ditching, not being able, however, to keep the intended headings. The crew then started a team work basis, discussing options with the third crewmember (co-pilot in the jump-seat) and trying to communicate with the technicians on board, to explore hypothesis and define an action plan. Despite no warnings for system failures, the crew decided to activate the flight controls direct mode elevators, rudder and spoilers), where the flight control module (FCM) is removed from the flight surfaces command chain, which are then controlled in a direct relationship with the pilots inputs on the yoke. The situation improved considerably, however, without restoring normal operation and keeping the difficulties to control the aircraft roll-axis. The crew realised that the ailerons were behaving erratically and therefore any command for the aircraft roll was kept to its minimum. Having gained some control of the situation, the crew flew East, searching for better weather conditions and started to follow the flight plan defined by the air traffic control for an emergency landing in a suitable airport, with good weather and physical conditions to deal with the sustaining aircraft control difficulties. At this moment, when the pilots were able to keep altitude and heading, and had sufficient visual references, the aircraft was joined by a pair of F-16 fighters from the Portuguese Air Force that were scrambled from the Monte Real Air Base. They assisted in guiding to Beja Air Base, which had been selected in the meantime as the best emergency landing option. After two non-stabilised approaches, the aircraft managed to land safely on runway 19L at the third approach. The intended runway was 19R, but due to drift, they finally managed to land on the left runway. All on board were physically and emotionally shaken, one of the passengers sustaining a leg injury. The aircraft sustained damage to the fuselage skin panels, showing waviness in some areas. All wing fixed leading edges were found wrinkled. The experienced overloads during the accident flight may have caused other non-visible damage to the aircraft structure. An assessments on the aircraft primary structure showed exceedance of the limit loads, and according to the structural evaluation that was conducted, some degree of detrimental permanent deformation was found on the aircraft.On May 31, 2019, GPIAAF Portugal published in investigation update, reporting that a detailed examination of the aircraft flight controls showed an incorrect ailerons control cable system installation.A modification carried out in accordance with an Embraer Service Bulletin (SB 190-57-0038) changed a cable routing support near rib 21 of the aircraft. This change made it harder to understand the maintenance instructions and spot reversed aileron cables.Probable causesThe investigation determined as most probable cause for the accident the improper aileron cable installation on both ailerons during maintenance activities and subsequent inadequate independent inspection to the aircraft flight control systems, which resulted in a reversal operation of the aircraft aileron system and led to loss of control in-flight.Contributing factorsFor the accident, the following factors contributed- Insufficient functioning of the AMO quality assurance and failure to implement an effective production oversight, including but not limited to the independent inspection procedures to detect maintenance escapes;- The AMO lack of proper risk management, based on an effective SMS program with maintenance escapes reporting system;- The lack of maintenance teams properly managed and organized by skills and specialties, with the necessary training and experience;- Weaknesses in the aircraft design, referring to the ailerons control system configuration, allowing the inverted cables installation in both PCU quadrants;- The aircraft manufacturers inaccurate depiction, complex and limitations on presentation of the aileron cables routing maintenance publications;- The aircraft manufacturers lack of proper maintenance instructions to detect the aircraft misconfiguration during the flight controls return to service procedure;- The lack of proper guidance or best practices from the OEM to the operator and AMO regarding aircraft acceptance and return to service, after a heavy or complex maintenance event;- The poor supervision of the maintenance organisation by the operator;- Deficient maintenance organisation oversight by the supervising authorities, namely on the internal maintenance supervision procedures and occurrence reporting;- The lack of proper guidance from the operator to the crew regarding aircraft acceptance after a heavy maintenance event;- The crew failure to detect the ailerons misconfiguration during the operational check procedures following limited SOPs on the highly routine pre-flight checks.",Ferry/positioning,GPIAAF Portugal ,2018

At 1057 local time, during the approach at Deer Lake, the flight crew selected the landing gear down; however, a weight on wheels caution light as well as advisory lights illuminated, indicating that the nose landing gear was not in the down-and-locked position. The flight crew executed a missed approach and entered a hold in order to troubleshoot the problem. At 1202, the flight crew requested a diversion to Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, and declared an emergency. At 1230, the aircraft landed on runway 27 at Stephenville with the nose landing gear in a partially extended position. On touchdown, the nose landing gear fully collapsed, and the aircraft nose structure came into contact with the runway surface. The aircraft slid and came to a stop approximately halfway down the runway.There were no injuries to passengers or crew.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. For undetermined reasons, a previous repair to the inner cylinder of the nose landing gear shock strut was not designated with a specific permanent marking as required by the approved component maintenance manual, resulting in the installation of a standard size bearing where an oversize bearing was required.2. The reduced sealing force caused by the smaller-than-required bearing installation likely allowed the nose landing gear shock strut to leak.3. The reduced hydraulic fluid volume, in addition to a possible nitrogen leak, reduced the internal static pressure of the nose landing gear shock strut and allowed it to partially compress when it was in the up position.4. The airflow encountered in flight when the nose landing gear was lowered further compressed the nose landing gear shock strut and allowed the tires to impinge on the aft landing gear doors, thereby jamming the nose landing gear in a partially extended position.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2018

The pilot meanwhile issued a Mayday call ""mayday mayday mayday citation five two five echo golf is in an emergency descent unable to gain control of the aircraft.""At 102718 the airplane was about 1,000 ft msl, with the airspeed about 380 kts and in a 53° left bank.  Two seconds later it impacted a slightly rugged, wooded area, leaving a trail of small debris, as well as blackened trees at a distance of 12 km north-northwest of the airport.The airplane was modified with a Tamarack Aerospace Group Active Technology Load Alleviation System (ATLAS) in May 2018. This system consists of added winglets and Tamarack Active Camber Surfaces (TACS), which are aerodynamic control surfaces mounted on the wing extensions that either hold their position in trail with the wing or symmetrically deploy trailing edge up or trailing edge down to alleviate structural loads. The NTSB reported that it found several contact marks on the left-hand TACS and the associated control unit, consistent with full trailing edge up position at the time of ground impact. xamination of the right TACS indicated that the it was in a neutral position at the time of ground impact. Such an asymmetric deployment of the TACS, with the left TACS likely in a position consistent with trailing edge up and the right TACS likely in a position consistent with neutral, would have induced a left rolling moment to the airplane.However, the accident roll rate of 5° per second was significantly less than the flight test data provided for a fully asymmetric TACS deflection at a critical failure initial condition. It is possible that the system was not experiencing a full asymmetric failure or that the full possible roll rate could not be induced because the airplane was not in the critical failure condition. The roll rate did change from negative to positive, and the roll angle did recover from 90° left wing down to about 53° left wing down before ground impact.If an asymmetric TACS deflection caused the left roll, it is possible the pilot was able to roll the airplane back to the right but not enough to fully recover and arrest the descent.Tamarack reported that it disagreed with the NTSB and that it intends to request the NTSB reconsider its finding.Probable Cause ""The asymmetric deployment of the left wing load alleviation system for undetermined reasons, which resulted in an in-flight upset from which the pilot was not able to recover.""30-11-201830-11-201830-11-201830-11-2018",Executive,NTSB ,2018
30-NOV-2018,Cessna 550 Citation II,N941JM,Dirt Dynamics,0.0,Fargo-Hector...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20181130-1,Approach (APR),Substantial,Icing Loss of control,"A Cessna 550, N941JM, departed controlled flight while on approach at the Fargo-Hector International Airport (FAR), North Dakota, USA and impacted the terrain to the right of the runway. The pilot and one passenger were not injured, and 9 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to the Slice of the 406 LLC and operated by Dirt Dynamics, Inc. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and the flight was operating on an instrument flight plan. The flight departed from the Williston-Sloulin Field International Airport (ISN), North Dakota, about 1250 with FAR as the destination.The pilot reported that the airplane encountered a cloud layer that was about 2,500 ft thick while he was on the approach to FAR. He stated that there was ice buildup on the wing surfaces, but he activated the deice boots several times during the approach to runway 18 (9,001 ft by 150 ft, concrete) and the airplane's performance was normal. The airplane became clear of the clouds about 400 ft above the ground (agl) and it was right of centerline. He flew back onto the centerline maintaining 120 kts during the descent. About 100 ft agl, the airplane started ""pulling to the right."" He applied left aileron and left rudder, and advanced the throttle to go-around. The airplane continued to the right and impacted the terrain seconds later. The passenger, who was sitting in the right seat of the cockpit, reported that the airplane started to take on ice on the windshield and the de-icing boot on the right wing while they were on the approach in the clouds. He reported that the approach was normal until they neared the ground when the tail started ""fish tailing."" He saw the pilot push the throttles forward; however, the left wing climbed and the airplane ""pulled hard to the right."" The airplane impacted the ground on its right wing and then impacted back on its belly. The initial examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing's outboard section was pushed up and aft. The nose wheel landing gear assembly was bent to the right, and the nose wheel trunnion assembly was broken in two pieces. The nose wheel assembly was separated from the fuselage with part of the trunnion attached to the wheel assembly. The left main landing gear was found folded into the gear wheel well, and the landing gear components were pushed upwards through the upper wing surface above the gear well.The examination of the wreckage revealed that there was about half an inch of mixed ice on the leading edge of the right wing, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer, and on the angle of attack (AOA) indicator.Probable cause ""The pilot's failure to lower the flaps during the approach and maintain sufficient airspeed while flying in instrument meteorological and icing conditions and the accumulation of ice on the wings' leading edges, which resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and subsequent aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of proper qualification to operate the airplane under a single-pilot exemption due to his lack of total turbine time, which led to task saturation and his failure to properly configure the flaps for landing.""30-11-2018",Executive,NTSB ,2018

One of the passengers occupied the right flight deck seat as an observer. This observer held a commercial pilot licence, but was not a member of the flight crewAt 1109, the flight departed Adelaide Airport. During the flight, the pilot received a Special Weather Report (SPECI), stating overcast cloud at 512 ft AMSL, below the approach minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 730 ft AMSL. The SPECI also reported visibility greater than 10 km and a southerly wind of 11 kt.At 1200, ODI commenced the Runway 18 RNAV approach behind a preceding aircraft. As the preceding aircraft continued the approach, the flight crew of that aircraft received an alert indicating the loss of the GNSS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and conducted a go-around.Despite not receiving a similar alert, the pilot of ODI also elected to conduct a go-around. He climbed the aircraft to an altitude of 5,000 feet and proceeded with the missed approach procedure to waypoint MTGNE to commence another approach. The other aircraft then advised that they would hold at waypoint MTGND while ODI conducted another approach.At 1215, ODI commenced a second approach to Runway 18 from waypoint MTGNE.During the flight and approaches, the observer contributed to the operation of the aircraft, a.o. by calling out operational checklists and monitoring the approach and calling out excursions from the target altitude.The approach chart indicated that a normal descent profile should position the aircraft at 980 ft, 2 NM prior to the missed approach point at MTGNM. As the aircraft crossed this point, the pilot announced that the aircraft was 'too fast by far' and 'high'.On multiple occasions throughout the approach, the pilot questioned and corrected information provided by the observer and educated her on the operation of the flight.As the aircraft descended to 730ft, the observer announced that they had reached the MDA. Upon reaching the MDA, the pilot could see the ground directly beneath the aircraft, but could not see the runway ahead. He then announced that he would conduct a go-around and retracted the landing gear, without announcing that he had done so. The observer was unaware that the landing gear had been retracted. After the pilot announced the go-around, the engine power level did not increase.Nine seconds after the landing gear was retracted, the pilot and observer sighted the runway. The pilot then reduced power and selected full flap to continue the approach. He noted that the required approach profile from that position was 'very steep'.At that time, the landing gear warning tone activated. As the approach continued, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) 'check gear' aural alert also activated. In response, the pilot incorrectly announced that the landing gear was extended. The approach continued, and 5 seconds later the GPWS alert 'pull up' also activated. The observer announced that the 'pull up' warning had activated. The pilot acknowledged this call, announced 'I've got it' and continued the approach. One second later, the 'pull up' and 'check gear' alerts ceased, but the landing gear warning tone continued (the pilot and observer both later recalled not hearing the landing gear warning tone or GPWS 'check gear' alerts).At 1222, the aircraft briefly touched down on the propellers and bounced. Two seconds later, the propellers again contacted the runway. The pilot, believing the landing gear was down and the aircraft had landed on the runway, twice attempted unsuccessfully to engage reverse thrust.The aircraft continued flying above the runway at low level and began to drift right toward the runway edge. The pilot, believing the aircraft to be rolling on the landing gear and not responding to brake inputs, assessed that it could not be stopped in the remaining runway and elected to conduct a go-around. He then increased engine power and observed good initial response from both engines followed shortly after by failure of the left engine.The pilot completed the initial engine failure actions and announced 'gear up, flap up' and the landing gear warning tone then ceased operating, consistent with flap retraction. Following the flap retraction, the stall warning activated intermittently for 16 seconds.The pilot shut down and secured the left engine and assessed that the right engine was performing as expected. He then conducted a visual left circuit at an altitude of about 600-650 ft AMSL, and at 1224 the aircraft landed on Runway 18 and vacated on to Runway 29 where it was shut down.The observer assisted with passenger disembarkation onto Runway 29 and escorted them clear of the runway. No persons were injured during the accident however, the aircraft was substantially damaged.Contributing factors- The pilot elected to continue the approach after initially deciding to conduct a go-around. The pilot's expectation of the landing gear position, possibly coupled with the effects of the now increased workload, probably led to him not detecting the retracted landing gear before the aircraft contacted the runway.Other findings- After the wheels-up landing, the decision to conduct a go-around resulted from the pilots misunderstanding of the situation and assessment that a runway overrun was imminent.",Unknown,ATSB ,2018

The crew recycled the landing gear but to no avail. With this abnormal condition the crew decided to return to home base at São Tomé Airport.At 1953 a forced nose gear-up landing was performed, resulting in substantial damage to the aircraft's nose area.Causal FactorsThe investigation determines that the cause of this accident asDuring towing of the aircraft, the pin for towing came out and at time of turning it damaged the nose landing gear torque link affecting the alignment and centering of the nose wheel.After take off and selecting landing gear up, the nose gear was stuck in the nose compartment due to 15° off deflection from centre point.Nose wheel could not be extended because it was stuck in the nose compartment.Contributory Factors1 Inadequate tow bar.2 Inadequate aircraft tow tractor.3 Aircraft tow tractor was technically faulty.4 Lack of appropriate training for ground personnel on aircraft towing.5 Undocumented ground personnel discharging maintenance duties.6 Roughness and degradation of taxiway surface.7 No action was taken for specific inspection on the nose landing gear for any damage caused during towing the aircraft.8 No compliance with Service Bulletin no.

The de-icing coordinators at the airport agreed that the aircraft was to be de-iced at stand 992, which was suitable for larger category aircraft like the B787-9. When clearing the flight to to the stand, the coordinator inadvertently cleared the aircraft to stand 991.The captain taxied the aircraft. He saw the light mast and thought that clearance on the right-hand side was marginal. However, he was confident the airport had control of the situation. He did, however, ask the first officer, who was in the right-hand seat, if he could see the distance between the wing tip and the light mast. The first officer could not see the wing tip and had thus limited ability to estimate the distance from his seat. The captain reduced the taxiing speed even more the last few meters.Before ET715 was assigned de-icing stand 991, two old de-icing vehicles were parked at the front edge of de-icing stand 991. There was an operator in each of the vehicles. As opposed to the more modern de-icing vehicles, the old de-icing vehicles were not equipped with a VHF radio. This meant that the two operators could not communicate directly with the ET715 crew.The driver of de-icing vehicle No. 11 saw the Ethiopian aircraft taxiing on to de-icing stand 991, and he knew that this de-icing stand could not be used by aircraft the size of the Dreamliner. At 190952 hours he called the de-icing coordinators over the internal radio and said that the Ethiopian aircraft had to be stopped.At 190957 hours de-icing coordinator made a radio call ""Etian seven one five you are going to wrong ... stop stop Etian stop stop stop.""At 191005 hours the tip of the right-hand wing of ET-AUP collided with the light mast to the right of de-icing stand 991. After the collision, the aircraft continued to move forward for about another four seconds, coming to a halt approximately four meters further ahead. Due to right wing torque, the nose of the aircraft turned towards the right and the nosewheel stopped approximately 3/4 meters to the side of the center line.The captain noticed the nose of the aircraft pulling right but  thought the aircraft had skidded slightly to the side and was not aware that the wing had hit the light mast. He stopped the aircraft and applied the parking brake. The crew again contacted the de-icing coordinator to inform them of the type of de-icing they required. They were then told that the right wing tip had struck the light mast.CONCLUSIONSThe AIBNs investigation has revealed that the following key factors contributed to the accidenta) The de-icing coordinator had by a slip-up assigned ET-AUP a different de-icing stand than the one he and his colleague had previously planned.b) The de-icing coordinators did not have adequate technical aids to ensure that the correct de-icing stand was assigned, based on aircraft category.c) SGH has been unable to present work instructions for the de-icing coordinators relating to allocation of de-icing stand for each aircraft category. A ""Coordinator procedure for allocation of de-icing stand at Oslo Airport Gardermoen"" is now taken care of.d) The crew on ET-AUP did not have access to information about what de-icing stands were authorized for their type of aircraft at Oslo Airport Gardermoen. Information about what de-icing stand can be used by the various aircraft categories was not included in the Aeronautical Information Publication Norway, or in NOTAM.e) Some type of anti-collision aid, such as a wingtip camera, would have clearly indicated to the crew that there was insufficient clearance between the wing and the light mast, thus preventing a collision.f) As the ET-AUP turned into the ""Bravo North"" de-icing area, there were no markings, lights, signage or other technical barriers to indicate to the crew that they had been assigned the wrong de-icing stand. Thus, the crew was unable to stop the aircraft before it hit the light mast to the right.g) As the aircraft approached the light mast, the commander thought that clearance was marginal. The crew decided to rely on the given instructions to taxi to de-icing stand 991.18-12-2018",International Scheduled Passenger,AIBN ,2018

The airplane was destroyed during the accident sequence and a post-impact fire and the four occupants onboard received fatal injuries.The pilot departed on an instrument flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Radar data indicated that the airplane entered a left turn after takeoff, consistent with the pilot's instrument clearance. As the airplane climbed to an altitude about 2,410 ft above ground level, its rate of climb increased from about 3,500 ft per minute to 9,600 ft per minute, the stick shaker activated, and the airplane decelerated to about 75 knots. The airplane then entered a descending right turn and rolledinverted before impacting terrain about 1 mile from the airport. All major components of the airplane were located at the accident site, and examination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.The weather conditions about the time of the accident included an overcast cloud ceiling about 600 ft above ground level. It is likely that the pilot became spatially disoriented after entering the cloud layer, which resulted in the airplane's high rate of climb, rapid loss of airspeed, and a likely aerodynamic stall. The steep descending right turn, the airplane's roll to an inverted attitude, and the high-energy impact are also consistent with a loss of control due to spatial disorientation.Probable CauseThe pilot's loss of airplane control due to spatial disorientation during initial climb in instrument meteorological conditions.20-12-201820-12-2018",Private,NTSB ,2018

There were no injuries to the passengers or crew onboard. According to the operator, the flight crew discussed the forecast weather for KCLT, and due to some inoperative equipment, no lower than category 1 visibility was required. The flight from KPHX to the KCLT area was reported as normal. Shortly prior to arrival, the flight crew received the latest weather update indicating conditions were 1/8 statute mile visibility in fog, with overcast clouds at 200 feet. ATC advised the crew that the RVR (runway visual range) was reported at 2800, 2600, 2900 feet; which was sufficient for landing. The flight crew discussed the approach and planned for a flaps 30 landing with a reference speed (Vref) of 125 knots and target speed of 130 knots. They planned to disconnect automation at 100 feet above the touchdown zone, in accordance with standard operating procedure.The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying, and reported the airplane was configured and stabilized at 1000 feet above touchdown, slightly fast and correcting. As they were approaching decision height, the crew observed the approach lights were in sight and disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. The FO indicated that he perceived the aural radar altitude countdown was fast and so reached for the throttles to push them forward. The airplane landed hard in the touchdown zone but did not bounce.An examination of recorded flight data by the operator indicated that following autothrottle disconnect, the airspeed decayed to about 107 knots at touchdown, with a pitch attitude of about 9 degrees airplane nose-up.Post-flight inspection of the airplane indicated the underside of the rear fuselage struck the runway. Inspection of the airplane revealed that several bottom skin panels were scraped, crushing damage to the Aft Pressure Bulkhead lower chords and web, several frame webs, chords, and associated shear ties were crushed, and the APU was found seized.

The flight crew comprised the captain (Pilot Flying, PF) and the co-pilot (Pilot Not Flying, PNF). Also, a ground engineer was on board. The purpose was to ferry the aircraft to Savonlinna to restart scheduled flights between Savonlinna and Helsinki-Vantaa. The runway at Savonlinna was cleared from snow but there was packed snow at the edges. Because snow kept falling, the runway condition was considered 'poor', which was reported to the arriving aircraft.At 0543 the captain reported being established on the ILS localiser. The AFIS officer reported that wind was 220 degrees at five knots and that runway 12 was free. The pilots used 20 degrees flap during the approach. According to the flight data recorder the approach was stable until the threshold. During the final approach the pilots saw the approach and runway lights well. Owing to the icing conditions they intended to use an airspeed which was 10 knots higher than the Aircraft Operations Manuals prescribed minimum approach speed. At the threshold their speed was 126 knots, while the approachs target speed was 120 knots.However, the airspeed at the touchdown zone markings was 123 knots. Contrasting from normal, the aircraft floated close to the surface for 6-7 seconds before touching down. The flight crew did not consider aborting the landing. Following the level flight the captain steered the aircraft toward the ground at a fairly high vertical speed. The aircraft touched down at 0550, approximately 307 metres after the optimal touchdown point, on the left side of the runway. At touchdown the airspeed was 109 knots, which corresponds to the 110 knot target speed. Judging by the marks on the snow the left main landing gear hit the left snowbank on the uncleared area. The nose gear touched the runway, following which the left main gear became airborne for a moment and the right main gear touched the ground. The left main gear touched down again. After having travelled approximately 100 metres from the first touchdown point the aircrafts nose gear and the right main landing gear moved outside the cleared runway area.The aircraft was tracking towards the left, away from the direction of the runway. The pilots tried to turn the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. According to the markings the aircraft began to turn and started to skid sideways outside the cleared area of the runway.When the left main gear hit a high snowbank outside the runway, the aircraft began to turn more sharply to the left. The left engine stalled when snow entered its air intake. The pilots did not deploy reverse thrust. The right main gear knocked one runway edge light over. The aircraft stopped in half-metre deep snow outside the runway, at a 110 degree angle in relation to runway 12.The accident caused considerable damage to the aircraft. Both of the aircrafts propellers were damaged as well as the nose landing gear.The Safety Investigation Authority stated that this accident demonstrated the fact that the operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member States aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. While the EUs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch.CONCLUSIONS1.

Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria.4. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch.5. The airline had not completely complied with its own safety management system. Oversight authorities do not always detect the difference between the safety management that operators promise to follow and their real-world practices.6. At no time did the flight crew consider aborting the landing.7. The airlines operational manuals (OM-A and OM-B) were inconsistent concerning maximum crosswind components. The instructions were difficult to follow in practice.8. Regardless of the alert to the Emergency Response Centre, no information about the airliner accident was relayed to the regions divisional officer on duty because, owing to the situation assessment, there was no need to deploy rescue service units.9. The Cockpit Voice Recorder had not recorded anything from the flight in question, and the earlier recordings that were retrieved from its memory were of extremely poor quality. The recording quality of the FDR, when compared to modern recorders, was poor. The magnetic tape of the FDR was worn, which caused defects in the recording.07-01-2019",Ferry/positioning,SIAF ,2019

The captain, first officer flight attendant, and 6 passengers on board were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. As the airplane arrived in the Uvalde area, ARTCC cleared the airplane to descend to 4,000 ft. After leveling off at 4,000 ft, the flight crew canceled their IFR clearance and proceeded to the airport visually. The pilot flew over the runway and entered a left downwind visual traffic pattern to see if there were any animals on the runway and what the windsock on the airport indicated. The pilot stated that they did not see the windsock as they passed over the runway. There were no animals on the runway, but the air was turbulent. The flight crew called their downwind and base legs over the airport's common frequency. On base leg, the pilot had the copilot set the flaps to 30°. As the pilot turned the airplane onto the final approach for landing, the copilot lowered the landing gear. The airplane was 4.5 miles from the end of the runway at 2,500 ft agl and an airspeed of 170 kts. The copilot completed the ""Before Landing"" checklist. The pilot confirmed the thrust reversers were armed and called for the flaps to be set to 45°. At 2 miles from the end of the runway, the pilot checked his approach speed and confirmed the landing gear was down.The pilot reported there was turbulence and wind gusts from the hills below and to the west of them. As they passed 50 ft. and coming over the runway, the pilot reduced engine power to idle. The pilot reported they then encountered a windshear. Their airspeed dropped rapidly and the airplane ""was forced down"" to the runway. The pilot unlocked the thrust reversers, applied brakes, and reached to deploy the ground spoilers. As he deployed the thrust reversers, the pilot said it felt like the right landing gear collapsed. He applied full nose-left rudder and left-wing-down aileron, but the airplane continued to veer to the right. The pilot tried using the tiller to steer to the left with no response. The airplane exited the side of the runway and went into the grass.A representative for the airport reported that the airplane on landing hit hard. About two thirds of the way down runway 35, the airplane slid off the right side of the runway. The airplane proceeded through a ditch and struck a perimeter fence before coming to a stop.Probable cause ""The airplane's encounter with wind shear on short final approach to the runway, which resulted in a hard landing and fracture of the right main landing gear.""12-01-2019",Executive,NTSB ,2019

The captain and first officer were fatally injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to Priority Air Charter LLC and operated by AFM Hardware Inc. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight, which was destined for Akron-Canton Regional Airport (CAK), North Canton, Ohio.The airplane was part of a test program for new, higher horsepower engine installation. Soon after liftoff and about 3 seconds after decision speed (V1), the left engine lost total power. The propeller began to auto-feather but stopped feathering about 3 seconds after the power loss. The airplane yawed and banked to the left, descended, and impacted terrain.The airplane struck power lines and trees before impacting the ground and came to rest about 200 yards from the end of runway 19. The main wreckage was upright and oriented on a northwesterly heading, with the fuselage separated forward of the wings. The left wing was broken aft and upward and the inboard leading edge of the right wing was crushed aft. The left engine was broken aft and outboard of the wing's leading edge. The right engine was broken downward at the nacelle. The nose of the airplane was located forward and left of the airplane main wreckage.Recorded engine data indicated the power loss was due to an engine flameout; however, examination of the engine did not determine a reason for the flameout or the auto-feather system interruption. While it is plausible that an air pocket developed in the fuel system during the refueling just before the flight, this scenario was not able to be tested or confirmed. It is possible that the auto-feather system interruption would have occurred if the left power lever was manually retarded during the auto-feather sequence. The power loss and auto-feather system interruption occurred during a critical, time-sensitive phase of flight since the airplane was at low altitude and below minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc). The acutely transitional phase of flight would have challenged the pilots' ability to manually feather the propeller quickly and accurately. The time available for the crew to respond to the unexpected event was likely less than needed to recognize the problem and take this necessary action  even as an immediateaction checklist/memory item.Probable cause The loss of airplane control after an engine flameout and auto-feather system interruption during the takeoff climb, which resulted in an impact with terrain.21-01-201921-01-201921-01-201921-01-20191 May 194443-15709USAAF23 Nov. 1945LR-AABMiddle East AirlinesMay 1951OD-AABMiddle East Airlines23 March 1965F-OCENAir DjiboutiApril 1971F-OCENAir Comores26 May 1976D6-ECBComores Goverment19896835South African Air ForceJuly 19966835South African Air Force15 Dec. 1997N145RDDodson Aviation5 Nov. 2002N145RDBaja Air Inc.28 March 2011N467KSPriority Air Charter",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2019

During the take-off run from runway 26 at CYUY, the aircraft began to veer to the left.  It continued to do so until the left main landing gear rolled off the surface of the runway and hit a snow windrow 5 feet beyond the edge of the runway. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and came to rest in a compacted snowbank 40 feet from the runway. One of the passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, landing gear, and propellers. The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, when visibility was reduced to approximately 2 statute miles in snow showers.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway.2. Given that the pilot monitoring was not looking out the window to monitor the aircrafts path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the pilot flying correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll.3. The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path.4. During the takeoff-rejection procedure, the pilot flying accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion.5. Since the pilot flying was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedures. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2019

The aircraft sustained significant damage to the right side of the fuselage that affected the airframe, the hydraulic system and the landing gear.Causes/Contributing factors The investigation has determined that the accident was caused by the loss of control of the aircraft on the ground in conditions close to the maximum demonstrated cross wind limit due to the fact that this maneuver was not performed according to the procedure published by the manufacturer. The following are considered to be contributing factors- The absence of communication between crew members on cross wind landing technique during the approach briefing.- The surprise and shock effect on the crew produced by the behaviour of the aircraft in the first moments after the landing, which affected negatively their subsequent actions and caused them to react instinctively instead of applying the procedure published by the manufacturer.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CIAIAC ,2019

The aircraft climbed briefly before beginning to descend again. The aircraft subsequently entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep descending left turn (spiral) from which the aircraft never recovered.The investigation established that both the captain and the FO had an iPad mini equipped with the ForeFlight Mobile application which had the capability to provide a backup attitude indication and synthetic vision view to both pilots.

For undetermined reasons, the left-side attitude indicator failed in flight.2. Although just before take off the crew acknowledged that the right-side attitude indicator was not operative, they expected it to become operative at some point in the flight. As a result, they did not refer to the minimum equipment list, and departed into instrument meteorological conditions with an inoperative attitude indicator.3. The crews threat and error management was not effective in mitigating the risk associated with the unserviceable right-side attitude indicator.4. The crews crew resource management was not effective, resulting in a breakdown in verbal communication, a loss of situation awareness, and the aircraft entering an unsafe condition.5. The captain did not have recent experience in flying partial panel.

The airplane was operated by Conquest Air Cargo on a cargo flight from Opa Locka to Nassau, Bahamas and back.The flight to Nassau was normal until the co-pilot had to adjust the left engine propeller control to adjust speed for cruise flight. When he manipulated the control, there was no movement on the gauge and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. He tried to re-set the propeller control circuit breaker, but to no avail. The captain equalized power on both engines and the flight was uneventful to Nassau. Once on the ground, the captain asked the co-pilot to send a text message to maintenance control, but the message never transmitted. The captain told the co-pilot not worry about it and if they were unable to re-set the propeller control on the ground during the engine run-up then they would shut down and call maintenance.The co-pilot stated to the NTSB that before they began the accident flight, the engines started normally and both propellers were cycled.

The en route flight, the descent and the initial approach for runway 27 at Billund proceeded uneventfully, with the aircraft being radar vectored for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach.On final approach to runway 27, Billund Tower cleared the aircraft to land and reported the wind conditions to be 200° 12 knots (kts), maximum 29 kts, and minimum 5 kts.Throughout the approach, the flight crew experienced moderate turbulence. The flight crew modified final approach speed (VAPP) was 148 kts (the flight crew added 2 kts the calculated VAPP of 146 kts).At 1000 ft, and at 500 ft Radio Height (RH), the first officer made calls on stabilized approach. The aircraft was configured for landing, with flap position 3, stabilized, and the autopilot engaged and the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode.At approximately 700 ft RH, the flight crew got visual contact with the runway. The Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) from 500 ft RH down to initial touchdown varied between approximately 160 kts CAS and 145 kts CAS. The aircraft remained stabilized on both localizer and glidepath down to 100 ft RH.On short final, the first officer informed the captain of a displayed crosswind of 36 kts. At approximately 190 ft RH, the captain disconnected the autopilot and flew the final approach manually with the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode.At 100 ft RH, the first officer made a standard operating call on aircraft pitch attitude Pitch 2.5. From approximately 100 ft RH until 35 ft RH, the vertical speed increased from approximately 700 ft/minute (min) to approximately 1100 ft/min. At approximately 25 ft RH, the captain used an abrupt and progressive aft sidestick input and pulled back on the sidestick to full aft  deflection to stop the rate of descent.The synthetic voice calls TWENTY, RETARD and the initial touchdown occurred almost simultaneously. Before recorded activation of both main landing gear squat switches (weight on wheels - WOW), the captain advanced the thrust levers forward of the climb detent position. The aircraft made an initial touchdown at approximately 148 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 5.63°, a rate of decent of approximately 750 ft/min, and a vertical acceleration of 2.59 g. Upon initial touch down, the ground spoilers did not extend, and the autothrust deactivated. The aircraft lifted off the ground and up to 12 ft RH.During the bounce, the captain repeatedly voiced his surprise on the lack of flare. In the air, the engines spooled up, and the CAS increased to approximately 156 kts. Two synthetic voice calls on excessive pitch (PITCH), and one thrust lever retarding synthetic voice call (RETARD) sounded.The captain retarded the thrust levers to flight idle resulting in ground spoiler extension. The aircraft made a second touchdown at approximately 154 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 9.49° and a vertical acceleration of 2.56 g. The aircraft tail section struck the runway.Upon landing, neither of the pilots perceived that a tailstrike might have occurred, and the flight crew continued taxiing to the apron. During taxi to the apron, the captain briefed the passengers on the hard landing.The AIB considers the contributing factors to this specific tailstrike to be- Gusting and strong crosswinds in dark night.- Moderate turbulence and downdrafts on short final to runway 27 at EKBI.- Too high sink rate, just prior reaching the flare height (destabilization).- No flight crew calls and/or decision on going around on short final or during the bounce.- Two hard landings.- Inappropriate thrust lever management.- Inappropriate pitch control during the bounce resulting in a pitch angle increasing beyond the critical angle.08-02-2019",International Scheduled Passenger,HCLJ Denmark ,2019

All three on board were killed.The aircraft departed Miami International Airport, Florida at 1133 hours local time (1633 UTC) on a cargo flight to Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Texas, USA. The cruising altitude of FL400 was reached after 20 minutes. Descent towards Houston was commenced at 1207 hours local time (1807 UTC). About 1230 the pilots contacted the Houston terminal radar approach control (TRACON) arrival controller and reported descending for runway 26L; the airplane was at 17,800 ft with a ground speed 320 knots.As the flight descended toward the airport, the flight crew extended the speedbrakes, lowered the slats, and began setting up the flight management computer for the approach. The FO was the pilot flying, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the autopilot and autothrottle were engaged and remained engaged for the remainder of the flight. At 1234, the airplane was descending through 13,800 ft, and the controller advised of an area of light to heavy precipitation along the flight route and that they could expect vectors around the weather. About 1235, the flight was transferred to the Houston TRACON final controller, and the pilot reported they had received the Houston Automatic Terminal Information System weather broadcast. The controller told the pilots to expect vectors to runway 26L and asked if they wanted to go to the west or north of the weather.Radar data indicated the airplane continued the descent through 12,000 ft with a ground speed of 290 knots, consistent with the arrival procedure. The pilots responded that they wanted to go to the west of the area of precipitation. The controller advised that to do so, they would need to descend to 3,000 ft expeditiously.About 1237, the controller instructed the pilots to turn to a heading of 270°. Radar data indicated the airplane turned, and the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated a selected heading of 270°. The airplane was descending through 8,500 ft at this time.About 1238, the controller informed the pilots that they would be past the area of weather in about 18 miles, that they could expect a turn to the north for a base leg to the approach to runway 26L, and that weather was clear west of the precipitation area. The pilots responded, ""sounds good"" and ""ok."" At this time, radar and ADS-B returns indicated the airplane levelled briefly at 6,200 ft and then began a slight climb to 6,300 ft.Also, about this time, the FDR data indicated that some small vertical accelerations consistent with the airplane entering turbulence.  At 123831, the airplanes go-around mode was activated.Shortly after, when the airplanes indicated airspeed was steady about 230 knots, the engines increased to maximum thrust, and the airplane pitch increased to about 4° nose up. The airplane then pitched nose down over the next 18 seconds to about 49° in response to nose-down elevator deflection. The stall warning (stick shaker) did not activate.FDR, radar, and ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a rapid descent on a heading of 270°, reaching an airspeed of about 430 knots. A security camera video captured the airplane in a steep, generally wings-level attitude until impact with the swamp. FDR data indicated that the airplane gradually pitched up to about 20 degrees nose down during the descent.The NTSB found that the first officers repeated uses of incomplete and inaccurate information about his employment history on resumes and applications were deliberate attempts to conceal his history of performance deficiencies and deprived Atlas Air and at least one other former employer of the opportunity to fully evaluate his aptitude and competency as a pilot.He had a long history of training performance difficulties and his tendency to respond impulsively and inappropriately when faced with an unexpected event during training scenarios at multiple employers suggest an inability to remain calm during stressful situations; a tendency that may have exacerbated his aptitude-related performance difficulties.Probable Cause The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captains failure to adequately monitor the airplanes flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industrys selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officers aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administrations failure to implement the Pilot Records Database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.23-02-201923-02-201923-02-201923-02-201923-02-201923-02-201921 April 1992N6063SBoeing1992C-GCAWCanadian Airlines International16 July 1992EI-CFRGPA4 Nov. 1992B-2561China Southern AirlinesJan. 1997CC-CRGLAN Chile14 June 2004CC-CRGLAN Airlines29 Dec. 2008LV-BTELAN ArgentinaApril 2010LV-BTELAN Argentina18 Oct. 2010CC-CRGLAN Airlines22 Oct. 2014N258CTCIT Leasing27 Jan. 2016N258CTAtlas Air5 April 2016N631GTAtlas Air8 Dec 2016N1217AAtlas AirApril 2017N1217AAtlas Air30 Apr 2017N1217AAmazon Prime Air",Cargo,NTSB ,2019

The aircraft slid sideways off the left side of the runway and became stuck in snow.  The six occupants were not injured.The aircraft operated on a flight from Baku, Azerbaijan. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. The flight crew performed an ILS approach to runway 24C at Sheremetyevo Airport. The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 24C and wind was reported from 300° at 5 m/s (10 kts) with gusts to 10 m/s (20 kts). At a height of 80 meters, the captain switched off the autopilot and continued manually. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 150 knots, 250 m pas the runway threshold. Brakes were applied and the thrust reversers were deployed. During rollout the no.2 engine was brought back to idle and the thrust reverser stowed. The no.1 (left) engine remained at maximum reverse, causing the aircraft to swing to the left, off the side of the runway.ConclusionThe reason for the accident with the Gulfstream G200 4K-AZ88 was the stowing of the right-engine reverser by the pilot KVS from maximum thrust reversal while maintaining maximum thrust reversal on the left engine, which led to the appearance of a significant turning moment to the left.The aircraft turning to the left in the presence of a cross wind to the right, as well as turbulence of the airflow near the rudder due to the open thrust reversal mechanism of the left engine and possible ice deposition on the outer surfaces of the aircraft, which led to the development of a significant swing moment on the rudder.The development of a significant articulated moment on the rudder, in the absence of power steering in the rudder control system, led to its deviation to the leftmost position despite significant (up to 82 kg or 180 pounds) forces exerted by the crew on the pedals. The deviation of the rudder (pedals) to the left also led to the deviation of the nose wheel to the left.The total moment from the running reverse of the left engine, from the right engine in direct draft mode, and from the rudder and nose wheel deflection to the left, led to the aircraft rolling out of the runway and its damage. Separate braking applied by the crew could not prevent the aircraft from rolling out.The contributing factors could have been- the crew did not take into account the provisions of the AOM about the possible ""destabilizing"" effect of the thrust reverse when landing with a cross wind on the runway with a reduced braking coefficient;- increased psycho-emotional tension of the crew members due to long dissatisfaction and emotional discussion of instructions and actions of ATC controllers. At the same time, the instructions and actions of the ATC service controllers were in line with established procedures.26-02-201926-02-201926-02-201926-02-2019",Executive,MAK ,2019

The captain was the PF for the sector and it was a line training sector for the co-pilot. There were five flight attendants (FAs), including an additional crew member.The aircraft pushed back and taxied out to runway 22 without event. ATC clearance was then given for the aircraft to line up and take off from runway 22. At the time it was dark outside, and the weather was clear with the wind from 160° at 5 kt. In the cabin, the lights had been dimmed for takeoff, as is normal practice.Having lined up on the runway, the captain set the throttles to full power/toga and commenced the takeoff roll. About one second after the co-pilot said ""thrust set"", at a groundspeed of 31 kt, a loud bang was heard and the aircraft immediately drifted towards the left of the runway. The captain said ""stop stop stop"" and rejected the takeoff.The aircraft came to a stop between the centreline and the left side of the runway. The captain then set the parking brake, selected the public address system (PA) button and announced ""attention crew on station"" twice. The co-pilot then informed ATC that they were stopping on the runway and then completed the actions for 'ENG 1 FAIL' and 'ENG 1 REVERSER UNLOCKED' electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM) messages; there were no fire indications. The left engine was shutdown at 200623 hrs.After the ECAM messages had been actioned the captain contacted the RFFS, who were quickly on the scene, to confirm that there were no signs of fire visible from the outside. As a result, it was decided to vacate the runway using the thrust from the right engine and he asked ATC for clearance to do so.At 200721 hrs, just as the captain was about to make a PA to instruct the FA to return to normal operations, he noticed an amber 'DOOR L [LEFT] FWD [FORWARD] CABIN' caution message illuminated on the ECAM. At first, he thought it was a fault but then saw the evacuation slide deployed at Door L1 out the left cockpit window and passengers moving across the front of the aircraft. The captain then had a conversation with the Senior Flight Attendant (SFA), over the interphone, during which the captain asked why the evacuation had been initiated. She replied that she believed he had ordered one, which he denied. After this conversation, the APU was started and the right engine, which was still operating while the evacuation was underway, was selected off at 200938 hrs.During the evacuation, the escape slide at door 3R (aft right-hand side) initially inflated and floated in the air because the engine was still running. This exit was then blocked. The slide at door 3L inflated correctly. Several passengers brought hand baggage with them, but it was removed from them and placed by door 3R. A similar situation with baggage occurred at doors 1L and 1R.AAIB ConclusionsThe left engine experienced a contained engine failure. All the damage found in the engine was consistent with the release of one or more high-pressure compressor stage 1 blades as a result of high-cycle fatigue arising from aerodynamic excitation of the blades. A single inlet guide vane lever arm, which had been improperly assembled in the connecting link on the inlet guide vane actuation ring, was identified as the source of the stimulus that resulted in the blade release.As a result of the engine failure and subsequent rejected takeoff, the Senior Flight Attendant commanded an emergency evacuation that was not necessary in the circumstances. This was probably the result of a combination of factors that heightened her emotional response to the event and affected her decision making. The factors included inexperience as a flight attendant, weaknesses in her training and communication difficulties during the event.As a result of the flight crew not being consulted before the evacuation was commenced, the right engine remained running for the first few minutes of the evacuation. This led to an increased risk of serious injury to those passengers that evacuated on the right side of the aircraft. Indeed, several passengers sustained minor injuries having been blown over by the exhaust.During the evacuation several passengers hindered the evacuation by taking their cabin baggage with them. While some were removed by the flight attendants at the supervised exits, this was not possible at the overwing exits. Two Safety Recommendations are made regarding passengers evacuating with carry-on baggage.01-03-201901-03-2019",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB ,2019

At the exact moment of the touch down, the wind was from a direction of 057° at 19kts.The contact of the aircraft with the ground occurred about 916m beyond the threshold of runway 15 with the right main landing gear completely outside the lateral limits of the runway, at a speed of 121kts. After landing, the aircraft traveled 668m outside the runway. The pilot regained control of the aircraft and returned it to runway 15.Contributing factors.- Control skills  a contributor.The corrections applied to the flight commands, in order to control the tendency of the aircraft to laterally deviate to the right in relation to the center of SBGL runway 15, were not sufficient to stop this movement, nor to redirect the aircraft to the central axis of flight. Consequently, the aircraft touched the ground with the right main landing gear outside the runway's lateral limits.- Organizational climate  undetermined.When considering the organizational climate present in the company at the time of the occurrence, it is possible that this scenario has influenced the assessments and, consequently, the crew's decision to proceed with the landing, despite the adverse conditions encountered.- Adverse meteorological conditions  a contributor.The significant change in the direction and intensity of the wind in the final approach, which started to blow from the left abeam, and the increase in the intensity of the rain on the Aerodrome, which impaired the pilots' peripheral vision and compromised the exact notion of depth of the aircraft in relation to the runway, contributed to the drifting movement of the aircraft to the right side of the SBGL runway 15.- Crew Resource Management  a contributor.When the aircraft was flying below 100ft height, the copilot conducted several callouts stating that the aircraft was off the runway axis. The commander collated the first ones, however, after a certain moment; he no longer properly responded to the copilot's callouts and proceeded to land, despite the repeated alerts received.The copilot, even realizing that the commander's corrections were not enough to control the aircraft and return it to the central axis of the runway, did not ask the commander, more assertively, to execute a go-around procedure in flight.This showed that the crewmembers had enough information to discontinue the landing, but they chose not to use this feature, which contributed to the occurrence.- Piloting judgment  a contributor.There was an incomplete assessment of the aircraft's flight conditions. Once the tendency of lateral deviation to the right of the central axis of the runway was detected, the pilots thought it possible to correct this tendency in time to make the landing safely, which contributed to the outcome of the occurrence.- Perception  a contributor.The maintenance of the focus on the lateral deviation of the aircraft interfered in the identification of other variables present, such as the condition of destabilization and low visibility, which could affect the landing in a safe way. Thus, this selective perception, reinforced by the expectation of completing the landing at the destination, contributed to the outcome of this occurrence.- Management planning  undetermined.All crewmembers on flight O66227 were called for the mission in accordance with the on notice roster. The calling of the copilot and the flight chief did not adhere to the established in the company's MGO; consequently, both were late to present themselves for the aircraft commander. Flight O66227 took off 30 minutes after the scheduled time.It is possible to consider that the delayed takeoff from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro had a negative influence on the assessments and the decision of the crewmembers to proceed with the execution of the landing.- Decision-making process  a contributor.There was a compromised analysis of the information available to the crew, so that the aircraft's destabilization condition was not considered, as well as the meteorological degradation in the final approach, culminating in the decision to try to correct the aircraft until the last moment, even if unanswered, and proceed with the landing on SBGL.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,CENIPA ,2019

The aircraft took off at 0613 hours local time with a crew of three, eight passengers and 500 kgs of cargo.Adverse weather conditions were encountered en route and the crew decided divert to Miraflores (SKMF) where it landed at 0739. There two more passengers boarded the flight for Villavicencio. At 0834 the aircraft took off from Miraflores and flew to San Jose del Guaviare (SKSJ) to refuel, where it landed at 0914. The aircraft was fueled and the crew submitted a flight plan to Villavicencio with a total flight time of 45 minutes an altitude of 8,500 feet. Prior to departure one more passenger boarded the flight. The aircraft took off at 0955. At 1015, when the aircraft was climbing through 8,100 feet and approximately 59NM (109 km) from Villavicencio, the flight reported engine problems and their failure to feather the propeller. At the crew's request, ATC provided information on the location of several aerodromes in the area and the crew chose to proceed to La Rinconada aerodrome.The aircraft lost altitude and last radio contact was at 1032 when the crew radioed that they had a runway in sight, with no further information.At 1034 the aircraft hit the ground of a palm plantation with a high angle of descent and low speed. Flaps and undercarriage were retracted at the time of the accident. The aircraft slid across a gravel road and burst into flames.Probable Cause(s).The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following probable causes- Loss of control in-flight as a consequence of the decrease in minimum in-flight control speed and drag generated by the impossibility of performing the No. 1 engine propeller feathering in the face of engine failure.- Malfunction of the lubrication system of engine No. 1, evident in the abundant oil leakage from the engine, in flight, and in the governor of the left propeller; although discrepancies were found in the maintenance of the propeller feathering pressure line, it was not possible to determine the origin of the oil leakage.- Weaknesses in the aircraft Operator's operational procedures, lacking a standard that would facilitate a crew's decision making to act in the event of critical failures, in matters such as making an emergency landing on unprepared field or the selection of an alternate airfield.Contributing Factors- Deficiencies in standard maintenance practices during repairs performed on the No. 1 engine's propeller propeller feathering oil pressure line.- Non-compliance with an effective and reliable maintenance program, which did not verify the operating conditions of the aircraft components; it was not possible to determine compliance with the last 50-hour service, Phase A, to engine No. 1 according to the company's maintenance program, since there are no records of that service in the Flight Log.- Inefficient safety management system of the Operator for not detecting errors in the maintenance processes and in the conduct and control of operations.09-03-2019194544-76773USAAFApril 194599826US Navy8 Oct. 1971N87611University of Texas6 Aug. 1980N87611Freedom Export29 Oct. 1980HK-2494SAEP1997HK-2494SAEP9 Sept. 1999HK-2494SADELCAOct. 2015HK-2494LASER",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,Aerocivil ,2019

There were no survivors among the 157 occupants.Takeoff roll began from runway 07R at a field elevation of 2333 m at 0838 hours local time, with a flap setting of 5 degrees and a stabilizer setting of 5.6 units. The takeoff roll appeared normal, including normal values of left and right angle-of-attack (AOA). During takeoff roll, the engines stabilized at about 94% N1. At 083844, shortly after liftoff, the left and right recorded AOA values deviated. Left AOA decreased to 11.1° then increased to 35.7° while value of right AOA indicated 14.94°. Then the left AOA value reached 74.5° in less than a second while the right AOA reached a maximum value of 15.3°. At this time, the left stick shaker activated and remained active until near the end of the flight. Also, the airspeed, altitude and flight director pitch bar values from the left side noted deviating from the corresponding right side values. The left side values were lower than the right side values until near the end of the flight.The captain attempted to engage the autopilot twice, but this resulted in two autopilot warnings.At 083906, the Captain advised the First-Officer to contact the radar controller and First Officer reported a SHALA 2A departure crossing 8400 ft and climbing FL 320.Between liftoff and 1000 ft above ground level (AGL), the pitch trim position moved between 4.9 and 5.9 units in response to manual electric trim inputs. At 1000 ft AGL, the pitch trim position was at 5.6 units.At 083922 and about 1,000 feet the left autopilot (AP) was engaged (it disengaged about 33 seconds later), the flaps were retracted and the pitch trim position decreased to 4.6 units.Six seconds after the autopilot engagement, there were small amplitude roll oscillations accompanied by lateral acceleration, rudder oscillations and slight heading changes. These oscillations continued also after the autopilot was disengaged.At 083929, the radar controller identified ET302 and instructed them to climb FL340 and when able a right turn direct to RUDOL. The First-Officer acknowledged this.At 083942, Level Change mode was engaged. The selected altitude was 32000 ft. Shortly after the mode change, the selected airspeed was set to 238 kt.At 083945, Captain requested flaps up and First-Officer acknowledged. One second later, the flap handle moved from 5 to 0 degrees and flaps retraction began.At 083950, the selected heading started to change from 072 to 197 degrees and at the same time the Captain asked the First-Officer to request to maintain runway heading.The autopilot then disengaged and at 083957, the Captain advised again the First-Officer to request to maintain runway heading and that they are having flight control problems.At 084000 shortly after the autopilot disengaged, the FDR recorded an automatic aircraft nose down (AND) activated for 9.0 seconds and pitch trim moved from 4.60 to 2.1 units. The climb was arrested and the aircraft descended slightly.At 084005, the First-Officer reported to ATC that they were unable to maintain SHALA 1A and requested runway heading which was approved by ATC.The column moved aft and a positive climb was re-established during the automatic AND motion.At 084012, approximately three seconds after AND stabilizer motion ends, electric trim (from pilot activated switches on the yoke) in the Aircraft nose up (ANU) direction is recorded on the DFDR and the stabilizer moved in the ANU direction to 2.4 units. The Aircraft pitch attitude remained about the same as the back pressure on the column increased.At 084020, approximately five seconds after the end of the ANU stabilizer motion, a second instance of automatic AND stabilizer trim occurred and the stabilizer moved down and reached 0.4 units.At 084027, the Captain advised the First-Officer to trim up with him.At 084028 Manual electric trim in the ANU direction was recorded and the stabilizer reversed moving in the ANU direction and then the trim reached 2.3 units.At 084035, the First-Officer called out ""stab trim cut-out"" two times. Captain agreed and First-Officer confirmed stab trim cut-out.At 084041, approximately five seconds after the end of the ANU stabilizer motion, a third instance of AND automatic trim command occurred without any corresponding motion of the stabilizer, which is consistent with the stabilizer trim cutout switches were in the ""cutout"" position.At 084044, the Captain called out three times ""Pull-up"" and the First-Officer acknowledged.At 084050, the Captain instructed the First Officer to advise ATC that they would like to maintain 14,000 ft and they have flight control problem.At 084056, the First-Officer requested ATC to maintain 14,000 ft and reported that they are having flight control problem. ATC approved.From 084042 to 084311 (about two and a half minutes), the stabilizer position gradually moved in the AND direction from 2.3 units to 2.1 units. During this time, aft force was applied to the control columns which remained aft of neutral position. The left indicated airspeed increased from approximately 305 kt to approximately 340 kt (VMO). The right indicated airspeed was approximately 20-25 kt higher than the left.The data indicates that aft force was applied to both columns simultaneously several times throughout the remainder of the recording.At 084120, the right overspeed clacker was recorded on CVR. It remained active until the end of the recording.At 084121, the selected altitude was changed from 32000 ft to 14000 ft.At 084130, the Captain requested the First-Officer to pitch up with him and the First-Officer acknowledged.At 084132, the left overspeed warning activated and was active intermittently until the end of the recording.At 084146, the Captain asked the First-Officer if the trim is functional. The First-Officer has replied that the trim was not working and asked if he could try it manually. The Captain told him to try. At 084154, the First-Officer replied that it is not working.At 084210, the Captain asked and the First-Officer requested radar control a vector to return and ATC approved.At 084230, ATC instructed ET302 to turn right heading 260 degrees and the First-Officer acknowledged.At 084243, the selected heading was changed to 262 degrees.At 084251, the First-Officer mentioned Master Caution Anti-Ice. The Master Caution is recorded on DFDR.At 084254, both pilots called out ""left alpha vane"".At 084304, the Captain asked the First Officer to pitch up together and said that pitch is not enough.At 084311, about 32 seconds before the end of the recording, at approximately 13,400 ft, two momentary manual electric trim inputs are recorded in the ANU direction. The stabilizer moved in the ANU direction from 2.1 units to 2.3 units.At 084320, approximately five seconds after the last manual electric trim input, an AND automatic trim command occurred and the stabilizer moved in the AND direction from 2.3 to 1.0 unit in approximately 5 seconds. The aircraft began pitching nose down. Additional simultaneous aft column force was applied, but the nose down pitch continues, eventually reaching 40° nose down. The stabilizer position varied between 1.1 and 0.8 units for the remainder of the recording.The left Indicated Airspeed increased, eventually reaching approximately 458 kts and the right Indicated Airspeed reached 500 kts at the end of the recording. The last recorded pressure altitude was 5,419 ft on the left and 8,399 ft on the right.10-03-201910-03-201910-03-201910-03-201930 Oct. 2018N1786BBoeing15-17 Nov. 2018ET-AVJEthiopian Airlines17 Nov. 2018ET-AVJEthiopian Airlines",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB Ethiopia ,2019

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from Harrisburg-Capital City Airport, Pennsylvania, and was destined for Monongahela-Rostraver Airport, Pennsylvania. According to the pilot, the airplane was on approach to Monongahela when he lowered the landing gear handle and heard a crunching noise. He noticed there were no green cockpit indicator lights to confirm that the landing gear was down and locked. The pilot then asked the co-pilot to circle the airport while he looked up the emergency procedures for extending the landing gear in the airplane flight manual. He tried to extend the landing gear manually, but it appeared to be jammed. The pilot and co-pilot discussed the situation and decided to fly to Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (LBE), Latrobe, Pennsylvania since the airport had a control tower and emergency equipment. The pilot flew by the tower and asked if tower personnel could see the landing gear down. The tower controller told him that the landing gear appeared to be down. During the subsequent landing roll , the left main landing gear collapsed, followed shortly by the right main landing gear. The airplane then slid to a stop on the centerline of the runway and the flight crew and passengers egressed the airplane.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the main landing gear mechanical linkage was compromised, and the right main landing gear actuator shaft was broken.

ATC notified the flight of moderate to severe precipitation in the area of UOX and provided a clearance to 11000 ft MSL. At 1508 ATC queried the flight for their altitude and informed the flight of moderate to heavy precipitation along their route of flight. The flight acknowledged the radio call and informed ATC they were climbing through 9000 ft for 11000 ft. About 1512 ATC queried the flight if they were having navigation issues or if they were deviating. The flight responded they were deviating and that they were having ""AC voltage problems."" The last radio call received from the flight was an acknowledgement of a heading assignment to 095 at 1513. The airplane disappeared from radar about 30 seconds later and the ATC controller tried unsuccessfully to raise the flight on the radio at that time.Preliminary radar data began tracking the airplane at 1506. The airplane transponder stopped transmitting Mode 3A information about 1508, so no altitude information was available for the remainder of the flight. The airplane maintained an approximate heading of 080 from 1506 until about 1510. At 1510 the airplane turned right to about 120 heading. At 1512 the airplane made a left turn to about 040 heading. At 1513 the airplane began a right turn that continued to a heading of about 270 until radar contact was lost at 151326.

The aircraft and helicopter were destroyed. One helicopter (Shree Airlines Eurocopter AS 350, 9N-ALK) sustained minor damage. The copilot of the Summit Air plane sustained fatal injuries. Two persons on the ground at the helipad also died in the accident.The L-410 was repositioning to Ramechhap after flying passengers and cargo to Lukla. The captain taxied the aircraft to threshold of runway 24 and handed over control to the co-pilot. Within 3 seconds of the takeoff roll the aircraft veered to the right and exited the runway, travelling about 43 ft across the grassy part on right side of runway 24, before striking the airport inner perimeter fence. It then continued to skid for about 43 ft, and hit two persons before it crashed into the upper helipad. It struck the turning rotor blades of 9N-ALC. The moving rotors cut through the cockpit and the helicopter toppled onto the lower helipad 6 ft below.The left-hand  wing of the aircraft broke the skid of another helicopter, 9N-ALK, and came to a halt with 9N-ALC beneath its right-hand  main wheel assemblyLukla Airport is located on a mountain at an elevation of 9334 feet (2845 m).

The helipad is located to the right of the runway, about 100 meters past the threshold.Probable CauseThe commission concluded that the probable cause of the accident was aircraft's veering towards right during initial take-off roll as a result of asymmetric power due to abrupt shifting of right power lever rearwards and failure to abort the takeoff by crew. There were not enough evidences to determine the exact reason for abrupt shifting of the power lever.Contributing Factors1. Failure of the PF(being a less experienced co-pilot) to immediately assess and act upon the abrupt shifting of the right power lever resulted in aircraft veering to the right causing certain time lapse for PIC to take controls in order to initiate correction.2. PIC's attempted corrections of adding power could not correct the veering. Subsequently, application of brakes resulted in asymmetric braking due to the position of the pedals, and further contributed veering towards right.14-04-201914-04-201914-04-201914-04-201914-04-2019",Ferry/positioning,AAIC Nepal ,2019

It was a training flight to acquire the type rating for the aircraft.The right pilot's seat was occupied by the pilot in command, who was deployed on this flight as a flight instructor. The student pilot, as co-pilot, sat on the left pilot seat and was the pilot flying. For the co-pilot it was the second flight day of his practical training program on the Cessna 551 Citation II/SP. The day before, he had already completed about three flying hours on the plane.At Siegerland Airport, three precision approaches to runway 31 were carried out with the help of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). After the third landing, the tower, due to the changed wind, turned the landing direction to runway 13. The cockpit crew therefore rolled the aircraft to the end of the runway, turned and took off at 1434 from runway 13. This was followed by a left-hand circuit at an altitude of 3,500 ft AMSL. The approach to runway 13 took place under visual flight conditions. According to both pilots, the checklists were processed during the circuit and the aircraft was prepared for landing on runway 13.In the final approach, the landing configuration was then established and the landing checklist performed.The copilot reported that shortly before the landing the speed decreased, the aircraft flew too low and the approach angle had to be corrected. He pushed the engine thrust levers forward to the stop. The pilot in command supported this action by also pushing the engine thrust levers forward with his hand.However, according to the pilot in command, the remaining time to touch down on the runway was no longer sufficient for the engines to accelerate to maximum speed in order to deliver the corresponding thrust.He also described that the aircraft had been in the stall area at that time. However, he had not noticed a stall warning.At 1442, with the landing gear extended, the aircraft touched down in the grass in front of the asphalt area of runway 13. The left main landing gear buckled and damaged the tank of the left wing. The right main landing gear also buckled, the tank on the right side remained undamaged. The kerosene escaping from the left wing ignited and a fire broke out.The aircraft burned and slipped along runway 13 on the folded landing gear, the underside of the airframe and the extended landing flaps until it came to a standstill after a distance of approx. 730 m from runway threshold 13.After the plane had come to a standstill on the runway, the copilot noticed flames on the left side of the plane.

A captain in training assumed the role of pilot-in-command (PIC) and Piot Flying while the line indoctrination captain acted as first officer (FO) and Pilot Monitoring on the flight.The FO conducted a pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and noted that the aircraft had about 1600 pounds of fuel on board. Because he preferred to order fuel directly from a fuel technician, he went to the fuel office in the hangar, but could not find anyone to take the fuel order. Intending to return to the office later, he went to the lounge where he found out that the flight would be delayed pending the arrival of the 2nd flight nurse. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the FO replied that it was.When preparing for departure, the flight crew completed the BEFORE START checklist. The last step on the checklist was to start the engine. The flight crew then taxied to a run-up area and began the AFTER START checklist. When the FO read out the checklist item FUEL QUANTITY, the captain responded with the text that was printed on the checklist, ""SUFFICIENT/BALANCED,"" but he did not check the fuel quantity indicators. When the checklist was complete, the crew taxied to the runway. The aircraft departed CYWG at 1639.Roughly 8 NM after the takeoff, while still in the climb, the captain performed a progressive fuel calculation. He did not look at the fuel quantity indicators during the process. The aircraft continued the climb and levelled off at flight level (FL) 250. During the rest of the flight, neither pilot performed periodic scans of the fuel quantity indicators.At 1813, when the aircraft was about 14 NM west-northwest of Gillam Airport (CYGX) and still level at FL 250, the left fuel pressure (L FUEL PRESS) warning light illuminated, indicating low fuel. The warning was followed almost immediately by power surging in the left engine. The captain turned the boost pump ON, and noticed that the fuel quantity indicators were showing 0 pounds. The captain asked the FO about the fuel quantity, at which point the FO realized that he had forgotten to order fuel. The flight crew declared an emergency with the Winnipeg Area Control Centre (ACC) at 1814 and began an emergency descent. The weather conditions at CYYQ were marginal, so the decision was made to divert to the alternate aerodrome, CYGX; however, the aircraft continued on the same heading toward CYYQ for another 2 minutesBy 1815, when the aircraft was at FL 220, the left engine had exhausted its fuel supply and lost power. The crew conducted the emergency engine shutdown procedure in the Emergency and Abnormal Procedures Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to shut down the engine; however, the left propeller continued to windmill at speeds between 1300 and 2000 rpm throughout the ensuing descent. At 181532, the FO programmed the FMS to display a track to CYGX and instructed the captain to turn right and follow the track. The FO moved the heading bugs, which were coupled on both FMS displays, to the CYGX heading. The captain then initiated a right turn toward CYGX.The captain reduced the power setting of the right engine. From 1815 to 1818, the rate of descent varied between 3000 and 6000 fpm. The crew extended the landing gear in an attempt to set up a suitable descent angle to Runway 23. At 1817, the flight crew informed the ACC that the nature of the emergency was fuel related. The ACC provided the flight crew with the weather at CYGX and informed them that emergency services at CYGX would be notified. As the aircraft descended through approximately 5000 feet above sea level (ASL), the FO obtained a vertical navigation (VNAV) profile to Runway 23 on the FMS. The crew retracted the landing gear as the aircraft intercepted the VNAV path. By 1820, the airspeed had decayed to approximately 100 knots and the captain was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. At times, the aircraft was descending below the VNAV path. Seeing this, the FO took over control and assumed the Pilot Flying duties. At 1821, as the aircraft descended through 2800 feet ASL, the left propeller ceased windmilling as the rpm decreased from 1300 to 0 rpm. The flight crew made a Mayday call at 182130 on the CYGX mandatory frequency. When the aircraft was at approximately 2000 feet ASL, it descended below the cloud base and the FO was able to visually identify CYGX.At 182234, when the aircraft was at 1300 feet ASL, roughly 835 feet above ground level (AGL), the right engine lost power. The aircraft could no longer maintain the VNAV path or a suitable visual approach to the runway. When the aircraft was at about 530 feet AGL and 1 NM from the runway, the crew shut down and feathered the right engine while continuing the right-hand curving visual approach to Runway 23.The flaps remained up throughout the approach and subsequent landing. The crew selected the landing gear DOWN when the aircraft was at about 50 feet AGL and the aircraft touched down on the frozen surface of Stephens Lake with the landing gear fully extended.Sufficient airspeed remained to enable the FO to raise the nose as the aircraft approached the rocky shoreline at the approach end of Runway 23. The aircraft struck the rocky shoreline in a nose-high attitude and skidded up onto the right edge of the runway area, coming to rest approximately 190 feet before the threshold .Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the first officer replied that it was, not recalling that the aircraft required fuel.2. While performing the FUEL QUANTITY item on the AFTER START checklist, the captain responded to the first officers prompt with the rote response that the fuel was sufficient, without looking at the fuel gauges.3. The aircraft departed Winnipeg/James Armstrong Richardson International Airport with insufficient fuel on board to complete the planned flight.4. The flight crew did not detect that there was insufficient fuel because the gauges had not been included in the periodic cockpit scans.5. When the flight crew performed the progressive fuel calculation, they did not confirm the results against the fuel gauges, and therefore their attention was not drawn to the low-fuel state at a point that would have allowed for a safe landing.6. Still feeling the effect of the startle response to the fuel emergency, the captain quickly became task saturated, which led to an uncoordinated response by the flight crew, delaying the turn toward Gillam Airport, and extending the approach.7. The right engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion when the aircraft was 1 nautical mile from Runway 23. From that position, a successful forced landing on the intended runway was no longer possible and, as a result, the aircraft touched down on the ice surface of Stephens Lake, short of the runway.24-04-2019",Ferry/positioning,TSB Canada ,2019

The airplane came to rest in the shallow waters of St. Johns River, sustaining substantial damage. The 143 passengers and crew survived.The aircraft was engaged in a charter flight to bring military personnel and family members home. The No. 1 (left) thrust reverser was not operational and deferred for the flight in accordance with the airplanes minimum equipment list. The captain was the pilot flying for the accident flight, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The captain was also performing check airman duties for the first officer who was in the process of completing operating experience training.Flight 293 departed Guantánamo Bay at 2319 UTC.At 2122 local time the pilot checked in with a Jacksonville approach (JAX) controller while level at 13,000 ft mean sea level and was provided the JAX altimeter setting; the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV runway 28 approach and moderate-to-heavy precipitation on the final approach to runway 28 (9000 ft/2743 m long).At 2123, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the winds at KNIP were from 350° at 4 knots; the pilot then asked if there was any chance of getting runway 10 because it looked a little better. The JAX controller responded that he was showing moderate-to-heavy precipitation building over runway 10 starting about 5 miles on final. The pilot acknowledged and said he would stick with runway 28.  He was then instructed to descend and maintain 5,000 ft.At 2125, the controller provided additional weather information to the flight crew, stating that moderate-to-heavy precipitation was present east and west of the airport. The pilot elected to continue for an approach to runway 28.At 2130, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the flight was heading northbound and the precipitation was moving eastbound; the controller then asked the pilot if he would like to try runway 10 since it might be better. The pilot acknowledged ""yeah go ahead, lets do it."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn left to a heading of 270°, and the pilot acknowledged.  Over the next several minutes, the flight was vectored for the approach to runway 10. At 2137, the JAX controller cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 10 approach, and the pilot acknowledged.  Shortly after, the flight was transferred to the KNIP radar controller.The pilot contacted the KNIP radar controller, and, at 2139, the KNIP radar controller indicated the winds were from 240° at 10 knots; he then cleared the flight to land on runway 10. As the airplane descended through 1,390 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilots configured it for landing with the flaps set at 30° and the landing gear extended; however, the speedbrake handle was not placed in the armed position as specified in the Landing checklist. At an altitude of about 1,100 ft msl and 2.8 nm from the runway, the airplane was slightly above the glidepath, and its airspeed was on target. Over the next minute, the indicated airspeed increased to 170 knots (17 knots above the target approach speed), and groundspeed reached 180 knots, including an estimated 7-knot tailwind.At an altitude of about 680 ft msl and 1.6 nm from the threshold, the airplane deviated further above the 3° glidepath such that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights would have appeared to the flight crew as four white lights and would retain that appearance throughout the rest of the approach. Eight seconds before touchdown, multiple enhanced ground proximity warning system alerts announced ""sink rate"" as the airplanes descent rate peaked at 1,580 fpm. The airplane crossed the displaced threshold 120 ft above the runway and 17 knots above the target approach speed, with a groundspeed of 180 knots and a rate of descent about 1,450 ft per minute (fpm). The airplane touched down about 1,580 ft beyond the displaced threshold, which was 80 ft beyond the designated touchdown zone as specified in the operators standard operating procedures (SOP).After touchdown, the captain deployed the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and began braking; he later reported, however, that he did not feel the aircraft decelerate and increased the brake pressure. The speedbrakes deployed about 4 seconds after touchdown, most likely triggered by the movement of the right throttle into the idle reverse thrust detent after main gear tire spinup.The automatic deployment of the speedbrakes was likely delayed by about 3 seconds compared to the automatic deployment that could have been obtained by arming the speedbrakes before landing. The airplane crossed the end of the runway about 55 ft right of the centerline and impacted a seawall 90 ft to the right of the centerline, 9,170 ft beyond the displaced threshold, and 1,164 ft beyond the departure end of runway 10. After the airplane came to rest in St. Johns River, the flight crew began an emergency evacuation.The airplane was mostly intact, but both main landing gear had separated from the airplane and were also located in the river.Probable Cause and FindingsAn extreme loss of braking friction due to heavy rain and the water depth on the ungrooved runway, which resulted in viscous hydroplaning. Contributing to the accident was the operators inadequate guidance for evaluating runway braking conditions and conducting en route landing distance assessments. Contributing to the continuation of an unstabilized approach were 1) the captains plan continuation bias and increased workload due to the weather and performing check airman duties and 2) the first officers lack of experience.03-05-201903-05-201903-05-201903-05-201903-05-201903-05-201903-05-201903-05-201912 April 2001N1787BBoeing26 Apr 2001N732MAMiami Air International31 Oct 2004N732MAMartinair Holland26 July 2005N732MAMartinair Holland22 Nov 2005N732MAMiami Air International19 May 2008G-OXLDXL Airways17 Sep 2008N732MAMiami Air International23 Mar 2010D-AXLIXL Airways Germany8 Nov 2010N732MAMiami Air International27 Sep 2012N732MAMiami Air International4 Jul 2016N732MATUI Airlines Netherlands6 Sep 2016N732MAMiami Air International3 Jul 2017N732MATUI Airlines Netherlands5 Sep 2017N732MAMiami Air International3 Jul 2018N732MATUI Airlines Netherlands11 Sep 2018N732MAMiami Air International",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2019
03-MAY-2019,Douglas C-47A (DC-3),C-GJKM,Buffalo Airways,0,near Hay River Ai...,https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20190503-1,Approach (APR),Substantial,Forced landing outside airport,"The Douglas DC-3C aircraft operated by Buffalo Airways, was conducting cargo flight 169 from Hay River (CYHY) to Yellowknife (CYZF), Canada, with 2 flight crew on board. After departure, while the aircraft was climbing through 1200 feet above sea level on the way to a cruising altitude of 5000 feet, the flight crew completed the after-takeoff checklist and applied carburetor heat to 20 °C. While the First Officer (FO) was applying the carburetor heat, oil pressure was observed decreasing on the left engine (Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92). Moments later, rising cylinder head temperature and oil temperature indications were also observed on the left engine. The captain directed the FO to contact the area control centre to declare a PAN PAN emergency and request a return to CYHY, which the FO then did. The aircraft flight manual (AFM) does not contain any procedures for abnormal engine indications.As the aircraft reached an altitude of 1969 feet, the captain set the left engine to a reduced power setting and increased the power on the right engine to maximum except takeoff (METO) power. The flight crew began to set up for an instrument landing system approach to CYHY via TANPO.At 0747, while the aircraft was in a right turn proceeding towards TANPO, smoke and oil were observed, and abnormal sounds were heard coming from the left engine. Using the engine failure checklist, the flight crew then shut down the left engine and feathered the propeller. At 0748, because the situation had escalated, a MAYDAY emergency was declared. Moments later, the flight crew completed the descent checklist and initiated the approach checklist. However, due to the escalating emergency, the flight crew was not able to complete the approach checklist, which included the landing briefing.At 0753, the aircraft levelled off at 1214 feet. The FO observed zero hydraulic pressure on the landing gear DOWN gauge. Thinking this zero pressure was an issue, he mentioned it to the captain, who then directed the FO to ""prep the gear."" The FO extended the landing gear, which the captain did not expect because the aircraft had not started its final approach and the airport had not been visually acquired.At 0755, as the aircraft continued towards TANPO, the altitude was between 1200 and 1300 feet ASL, and the airspeed was maintained at approximately 100 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). When the aircraft was abeam TANPO, the captain began a right turn to intercept the localizer for the final approach. The aircrafts airspeed decreased from 100 KIAS to 80 KIAS, while its altitude decreased to 1100 feet ASL. With the reduced airspeed, the aircrafts flight control response became sluggish and the captain directed the landing gear to be raised.After the landing gear was raised, at 0759, the flight crew heard abnormal sounds and felt vibrations from the right engine. The aircrafts airspeed was 80 KIAS, and its altitude began to decrease to below 800 feet ASL.  In an attempt to maintain altitude, the right engine was increased to maximum takeoff power, but this had no effect. The flight crew then prepared for an emergency gear-up landing, and the aircrafts flaps were lowered on short final to reduce speed for touchdown.At 0801, the aircraft landed in muskeg on KatlOdeeche First Nation land, approximately 3.5 nautical miles southeast of CYHY. After the aircraft came to a stop, the FO exited the aircraft through the right-hand crew window, while the captain remained in the cockpit to secure the right engine and aircraft systems before evacuating via the forward door. The FO contacted the flight information centre to notify them of the crews status and aircraft location. The emergency locator transmitter had not activated during the forced landing, so the FO activated it manually to assist search and rescue in locating the aircraft. The flight crew was uninjured. The aircraft received substantial damage. There was no post-impact fire. First responders arrived at the accident site at 1114In this occurrence, the aircrafts airspeed and altitude could not be maintained, primarily because of the increased drag when the landing gear was extended early in the approach.03-05-201903-05-2019",Cargo,TSB Canada ,2019

Of the 78 persons on board, 41 did not survive.The aircraft took off from Sheremetyevo Airport's runway 24C at 1803 hours local time on a scheduled service to Murmansk, Russia. Visibility was fine but there were some Cumulonimbus clouds near the airfield at 6000 feet.The flight crew engaged the autopilot as the aircraft climbed through a height of 700 ft (215 m). At 1808, as the aircraft was climbing through an altitude of about 8900 ft (2700 m), a failure occurred in the electrical system. At this point, the aircraft was 30 km west-northwest of the airport in an area of thunderstorm activity.The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft and the crew managed to establish radio contact using UHF. The flight was not able to contact the approach controller and subsequently selected the emergency transponder code 7600 (loss of radio communication).About 1817 the aircraft overshot the runway centreline after turning to runway heading. Altitude at that time was about 2400 feet. The aircraft continued the right-hand turn, completed a circle and proceeded on the final approach for runway 24L. Flaps were selected at 25°, which was the recommended setting for landing above maximum landing weight.At 1826 the flight crew selected the emergency transponder code 7700 (emergency).When descending from 335 to 275 m (1100-900 ft) the windshear warning system sounded five times ""Go around. Windshear ahead"".From a height of 80 m (260 ft) above ground level, the aircraft descended below the glide path and at a height of 55 m (180 ft) the TAWS warning sounded ""Glide Slope."" From that moment on the airspeed increased to 170 knots.At 1830 the aircraft overflew the runway threshold and touched down at a distance of 900 m past the threshold at a speed of 158 knots. Touchdown occurred at a g-force of at least 2.55g with a subsequent bounce to a height of about 2 m. After two seconds the aircraft landed again on the nose landing gear with a vertical load 5.85g, and bounced to a height of 6 m. The third landing of the aircraft occurred at a speed of 140 knots with a vertical overload of at least 5g. This caused a rupture of the wing structure and fuel lines. Flames erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. The aircraft slid to a stop on the grass between runway 24L and two taxiways. An emergency evacuation was then carried out while flames quickly engulfed the rear fuselage.05-05-201905-05-201905-05-201905-05-201905-05-2019",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,MAK ,2019

Weather at Yangon was poor due to the presence of a thunderstorm in the area. While the flight crew was performing an ILS approach, the controller instructed them to go around as the airport was closed due to weather. When the weather condition got better, the flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21 because only the localizer was available at that moment. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying and the captain was Pilot Monitoring. The aircraft was higher than the 3 degree approach path and the airspeed fluctuated between 136 and 151 kts, which was than the 122 kts target airspeed.The captain said ""continue, continue"" to the copilot and the approach was continued. At an altitude of 22 feet over the runway, the captain began pushing the control column forward, while the PF was attempting to pull on the control column. At 1828 m down the runway, with 1585 m remaining, the aircraft briefly skipped a few times before getting airborne again.

The five occupants of the DHC-2 sustained fatal injuries. The DHC-3 pilot sustained minor injuries, nine passengers sustained serious injuries, and one passenger sustained fatal injuries. The purpose of both flights was to transport passengers to Ketchikan from the Misty Fjords National Monument area in Alaska, USA. Both flights were converging on a scenic waterfall before returning to the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base.At 121715, the DHC-3 was about level at 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a track of 225°, and the DHC-2 was 4.2 nautical miles south of the DHC-3, climbing through 2,800 ft msl, on a track of 255°. About 1219, the DHC-3 started a descent from 4,000 ft msl, and the DHC-2 was at 3,175 ft msl and climbing. During the next 1 minute 21 seconds, the DHC-3 continued to descend on a track between 224° and 237°, and the DHC-2 leveled out at 3,350 ft msl on a track of about 255°. The airplanes collided at 122114 at an altitude of 3,350 ft msl, 7.4 nm northeast of Ketchikan Harbor.The DHC-3 pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight from the Misty Fjords area had proceeded normally, and he had descended and was maneuvering the airplane to show passengers a waterfall near Mahoney Lake when the collision occurred. Just prior to the collision, he saw a flash from his left side, and experienced a large, loud impact. According to the pilot, the DHC-3 airplane then rolled right and pitched about 40 degrees nose down toward the water in George Inlet. The pilot stated that he was able to maintain some control and flare the airplane prior to impact. The pilot, some passengers, and some bystanders helped the passengers of the DHC-3 evacuate the airplane and move to the shore. The DHC-3 main wreckage came to rest about 80 ft underwater about 400 ft off the east shore of George Inlet.The DHC-2 airplane broke up in-flight after the collision, and the wreckage was scattered over water and mountainous tree-covered terrain northeast of Mahoney Lake on the west shore of George Inlet.Both aircraft were ADS-B-equipped and both pilots were presented with visual traffic information through the iPad with ForeFlight app (DHC-2) and Chelton display (DHC-3). However, the Garmin GSL 71 on the DHC-3 had been turned off, causing pressure altitude of the airplane not to be transmitted with the ADS-B data. Thus, both systems were not able to generate warnings of potential conflicts.Additionally, the DHC-2 was obscured from the Otter pilot's vision by the window frame until the very last moment. The Beaver pilot likely was unable to see the Otter approaching from behind due to the aircraft structure and the passenger seated on his right.Probable CauseThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, which prevented the two pilots from seeing the other airplane before the collision, and the absence of visual and aural alerts from both airplanes traffic display systems, while operating in a geographic area with a high concentration of air tour activity. Contributing to the accident were (1) the Federal Aviation Administrations provision of new transceivers that lacked alerting capability to Capstone Program operators without adequately mitigating the increased risk associated with the consequent loss of the previously available alerting capability and (2) the absence of a requirement for airborne traffic advisory systems with aural alerting among operators who carry passengers for hire.13-05-2019",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2019

A stopover was made at Salta Airport.The aircraft took off from Salta at 1215 hours local time and after 15 minutes of flight, with the runway in sight, the crew silenced the aural alarms of the TAWS in order to avoid such alarms, since the aerodrome was not registered in the aircraft's navigation database.In the final landing phase, the crew observed a flock of medium-sized birds that diverted their attention. Close to touchdown, after checking instrument readings and speed, the crew sensed that the aircraft continued to descend without making contact with the runway at the altitude it normally did. While the aircraft was making contact with the runway, the commander in the non-flying pilot role, lowered the landing gear lever, but was unable to complete the extension. The aircraft decelerated on the fuselage for 500 metres over the runway and then exited the runway to the left.With the aircraft stopped, evacuation took place. The passengers and crew were uninjured. The accident occurred during daylight and in good weather conditions.Conclusions regarding factors related to the accident- Prior to take-off, the cockpit speaker mute function was activated, which was only enabled on the pilot and co-pilot headsets.- All warning and terrain proximity system audios were muted.- The crew removed their headsets during the final approach phase.- The presence of birds during final landing could have been a distracting factor in one of the most critical phases of the flight.- Procedural checklists were not used.- The landing gear was not extended.17-06-201917-06-2019",Executive,JIAAC Argentina ,2019

Before departing CYFH on the occurrence flight, the crew conducted the before-takeoff checklist, which requires the propeller automatic feathering system to be armed for takeoff; however, the crew did not arm this system.At approximately 0140, the aircraft departed CYFH with the first officer acting as the pilot flying (PF), seated in the right seat, and the captain acting as the pilot not flying (PNF), seated in the left seat. Shortly after takeoff, the PF called for the landing gear to be retracted. The PNF then selected the gear up at approximately 200 feet above ground level (AGL). Both engines subsequently lost power simultaneously, and the flight crew executed a forced landing on Eabamet Lake, Ontario, in total darkness.The aircraft fuselage remained intact and immediately began to fill with water. The flight crew retrieved the survival kit, evacuated the aircraft via the main cabin door, and swam to shore.Once on shore, the flight crew started a fire to warm up.

There were four crew on board.The aircraft was on the departure runway with the brakes on. Power was applied to both engines, but when take-off power was reached, and prior to the release of the brakes, the crew heard a loud bang. In response, the captain aborted the take-off, reduced both power levers to flight idle, and instructed the FO to contact air traffic control (ATC) to advise they were aborting the take-off and had an engine issue. Air traffic control acknowledged the advice and reported sighting smoke from the right engine before informing emergency services. The captain checked the right engine instrumentation and advised the crew that the torque gauge had failed, and the propeller RPM gauge indicated zero. Other indications for the gas core of the engine, such as fuel flow, appeared normal. The captain instructed the FO to shut down the engine.After confirming the aircraft brake, hydraulic and electrical systems were functioning, the crew returned the aircraft to the maintenance hangar. A subsequent inspection of the runway by a safety car identified metal fragments behind the take-off position.The right engine was subsequently removed from the aircraft with an external inspection revealing that all of the second-stage power turbine (PT2) blades had separated from the disk. The PT assembly could not be rotated but the propeller shaft turned freely.Contributing factors- The power turbine shaft of the aircrafts right engine fractured due to fatigue cracking, resulting in secondary damage and engine failure.- The fatigue cracking in the engines power turbine shaft initiated at corrosion pitting, which probably resulted from prolonged low-altitude operation in a marine environment.- The power turbine shaft in Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 series engines operating in certain marine environments is susceptible to corrosion pitting, which can grow undetected between scheduled inspections. This increases the risk of shaft fracture resulting in engine failure. [Safety issue]",Survey/research,ATSB ,2019

The captain of the aircraft exercised the function of Pilot Flying (PF) and the copilot Pilot Monitoring (PM).  This flight was the first landing at Barra Grande for the captain.The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the aircraft joined the traffic circuit after crossing overhead at 1500 feet. On the downwind leg the captain took two photos of the runway. The downwind leg was extended to 4.5 nm. When turning to final approach, the aircraft was configured for landing. Also, the aircraft's Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) had been silenced since the avionics system database did not contain information related to the Barra Grande Airport.On final approach, at around 1,200ft, the flaps were selected down to 40° (full) at a speed of 136 KIAS. The aircraft descended below the glide path and the airspeed had decreased to 106 knots when the copilot called out the airspeed and stated ""Go around."". The captain then verified a.o. the position of the landing gear. When, the captain returned to look ahead, he noticed the aircraft was far below the ideal glide path and very close to the threshold of runway 11.Immediately, he applied maximum power to the engines and pitched up the aircraft. Due to the delay in the acceleration of the engines, the aircraft continued to descend and it collided with a signpost. It then struck a ravine near the threshold of runway 11, causing the undercarriage to break. Then, the captain reduced the power of the engines to Idle and commanded the speed break on, forcing the aircraft to touch the runway.The airplane slid along the runway, dragging the lower fuselage and the lower wing, until it slid off the left side.  A fire erupted, that consumed most of the aircraft.Contributing factors.- Control skills - a contributor.The inadequate performance of the controls led the aircraft to make a path that was lower than the ideal. This condition had the consequence of touching the ground before the runways threshold.- Attention - undetermined.During the approach for landing, the commander divided his attention between the supervision of the copilot's activities and the performance of the aircraft's controls. Such circumstances may have impaired the flight management and limited the reaction time to correct the approach path.- Attitude - undetermined.The report that the commander took two photographs of the runway and of the Aerodrome with his cell phone, during the downwind leg, reflected an inadequate and complacent posture in relation to his primary tasks at that stage of the flight, which may have contributed to this occurrence.- Communication - undetermined.As reported by the commander, the low tone and intensity of voice used by the copilot during the conduct of callouts, associated with the lack of use of the head phones, limited his ability to receive information, which may have affected his performance in management of the flight.- Crew Resource Management - a contributor.The lack of proper use of CRM techniques, through the management of tasks on board, compromised the use of human resources available for the operation of the aircraft, to the point of preventing the adoption of an attitude (go-around procedure) that would avoid the accident, from the moment when the recommended parameters for a stabilized VFR approach are no longer present.- Illusions - undetermined.It is possible that the width of the runway, narrower than the normal for the pilots involved in the accident, caused the illusion that the aircraft was higher than expected, for that distance from the thrashold 11 of SIRI, to the point of influence the judgment of the approach path.In addition, the fact that the pilot was surprised by the geography of the terrain (existence of dunes) and the coloring of the runway (asphalt and concrete), may have led to a false visual interpretation, which reflected in the evaluation of the parameters related to the approach path.- Piloting judgment - a contributor.The commander's inadequate assessment of the aircraft's position in relation to the final approach path and landing runway contributed to the aircraft touching the ground before the threshold.- Perception - undetermined.It is possible that a decrease in the crew's situational awareness level resulted in a delayed perception that the approach to landing was destabilized and made it impossible to correct the flight parameters in a timely manner to avoid touching the ground before the runway.- Flight planning - undetermined.It is possible that, during the preparation work for the flight, the pilots did not take into account the impossibility of using the perception and alarm system of proximity to the ground that equipped the aircraft, and the inexistence of a visual indicator system of approach path at the Aerodrome.- Other / Physical sensory limitations  undetermined.The impairment of the hearing ability of the aircraft commander, coupled with the lack of the use of head phones, may have interfered with the internal communication of the flight cabin, in the critical phase of the flight.",Private,CENIPA ,2019

The private pilot was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.Upon arrival at the airplane, the pilot began to perform preflight checks and completed a walkaround. After boarding and closing the cabin door, he continued with the checks and observed haze in the cabin accompanied by a faint smell of smoke. He continued to follow the checklists and after starting the engine, the smoke smell became stronger, and he decided to terminate flight preparations, and have a mechanic examine the airplane.After completing the engine shutdown, he opened the main cabin door, and began to see smoke issue from the armrest area of the number 5 (right center) passenger seat. A mechanic arrived at the airplane with a fire extinguisher within a few minutes, however the smoke had become dense, and was now streaming out of the cabin door. A few minutes later, flames began to emerge from the cabin, and by 1155 the cabin was completely engulfed. The fire department arrived at 1202, and the fire was extinguished.The airplane sustained extensive thermal damage, with fire consuming the cabin roof and destroying the cabin contents from the aft wall of the parachute (CAPs) enclosure through to the engine inlet nacelle, with fire damage more extensive on the right side of the airframe. Fire had consumed the lower right walls of the cabin down to the wing root, with only composite cloth remaining. The right wing was intact, but sustained thermal damage to the upper skin from the root outboard about 4 ft short of the tip. The left wing, and lower left exterior skins of the cabin were largely free of fire damage.An investigation determined the probable root cause was a malfunction of the headset amplifier and the microphone interface circuit card assemblies for the 3.5 millimeter audio and microphone jacks. This malfunction likely resulted in an electrical short and subsequent uncontained cabin fire without activating circuit protection. On February 14, 2020, the FAA issued an emergency AD to  disconnect and remove the headset amplifier and microphone interface circuit card assemblies for the 3.5 mm audio and microphone jacks on all Cirrus SF50's.27-12-2019",Private,NTSB ,2019

Inside the hangar a Dassault Falcon 900 jet (N908CA) and a helicopter sustained some damage.The engines were starte at 0903. In preparation for departure, the pilots did not call for the airplanes Before Engine Starting, Engine Starting, Before Taxi, or Before Takeoff (Runup) checklists nor did they discuss any emergency procedures.The pilot contacted ground control about 0905 stating he was ready to taxi and was provided taxi instructions to runway 15. At 090941, the local controller gave the pilot departure instructions to turn left to heading 050 and cleared the flight for takeoff from runway 15. A sound similar to an increase in propeller rpm was recorded about 091011, and the co-pilot called ""airspeeds alive"" at 091025. Rotation occurred about 091032 at a groundspeed of about 101 knots (102 knots calibrated airspeed).The airplane fully lifted off the ground about 1,900 ft from the beginning of the takeoff roll at a groundspeed of about 105 knots (106 knots calibrated airspeed). The pilots did not verbalize any V speeds before or during the takeoff roll. With the reported weather conditions (wind at 6 knots from 100° and temperature at 26°C) and at maximum takeoff weight, the takeoff decision speed (V1) for the flight would have been 106 knots, Vr (rotation speed) would have been 110 knots, V2 (takeoff safety speed) would have been 117 knots, and Vmc (minimum controllable airspeed) would have been 96 knots (with flaps retracted) or 94 knots (with the flaps at the approach setting of about 14º).Six seconds after liftoff (091040), the pilot stated, ""what in the world?"" The no.1 (left) engine had lost almost all thrust. At 091043, the co-pilot stated, ""you just lost your left engine."" The airplane had passed over the left edge of runway 15 at this time. The pilot responded to the emergency with left rudder input, the opposite action of what the emergency called for. Seconds later, the pilot applied right rudder but by that point the airplane was rolling inverted, and there was insufficient altitude for recovery.The stall warning horn and ""bank angle"" annunciator sounded as the aircraft rolled left after reaching a maximum altitude of 100 ft agl. At 091051, the sound of the airplanes impact with the hangar was recorded. The airplane rolled to its left and impacted the hangar in an inverted attitude. The airplane then impacted the hangar floor, breached a closed roll-up garage door, came to rest on its right side outside of the hangar, and was consumed by fire.A detailed examination of the left engine and its control systems found no condition that would have prevented normal operation. The NTSB noted that there was a known risk of an unintentional movement of an engine power lever if its friction lock was adjusted incorrectly. Friction lock settings are one of the items in a pre-takeoff checklist the pilot failed to use.Investigators were unable to determine if the friction lock settings played a role in the loss of thrust on the left engine. The cause for loss of engine thrust could not be determined.PROBABLE CAUSE ""The pilots failure to maintain airplane control following a reduction of thrust in the left engine during takeoff.

The flight departed	Jaipur International Airport with the captain as Pilot Flying. The pilots had carried out briefing for the approach including the weather and go around actions, if required. The aircraft commenced descent into Mumbai in the late evening hours. As per the reported weather at the time of approach visibility was 2100 metres in rain. Reported winds were 090/12 Knots. Runway was wet and the trend provided was ""temporary reduction in visibility to 1500 metres with thunder/ showers of rain"". During descend at an IAS disagree warning was observed, indicating a discrepancy of airspeed between the instrument sources for the flight crew. Although this indication was momentary, the Non-Normal Checklist was carried out. The indication discrepancy did not recur for the remainder of the flight. The aircraft was radar vectored for an ILS approach for Runway 27 at Mumbai. The approach was stabilized by 38700 feet with landing gear down and flaps 30 and auto brake selected at 3. The autopilot was engaged throughout the descent phase and during approach, the second autopilot was coupled for the ILS approach. At 100 feet, the autopilot and the auto-throttle were disengaged by the PF. The flare manoeuvre consumed approximately 5807 feet of the runway length prior to touchdown with 3881 feet runway remaining. After touchdown, the speed brakes deployed automatically and maximum reverse thrust and wheel brakes were applied. The aircraft exited the paved surface at 65 Knots and came to rest at a distance of 615 feet beyond the end of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed.Once the aircraft came to rest, the flight crew advised cabin crew to be at their stations. The pilots were unable to contact ATC through VHF communication. The PF contacted his airline personnel using mobile phone and informed that the aircraft had overrun the runway and requested for step ladders. The ATC activated fire services and the runway was closed for operation. An assessment of the aircraft structure and occupants was made and the fire services personnel informed the cabin crew that deplaning was to be carried out using fire ladders. There were no injuries during evacuation or otherwise.Probable CauseThe runway excursion occurred because of combination of - Disconnection of auto pilot at an altitude 118' RA with the nose up trim bias without adequate compensation.- Disconnection of auto throttle at 118' RA at a higher thrust setting for that phase of flight.- Late touchdown of the aircraft on the runway.- Reduced visual cues due to heavy rain impacting depth perception and ascertaining of actual touchdown position.- Tailwind conditions at the time of landing resulting In increasing the distance covered during the extended flare (float).- Approach with lower flaps (30) than recommended (40).",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2019

The pilot stated that after contacting the Bethel Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) about 10 miles west of the airport, he offered to use runway 12, because it was a more expeditious arrival from the west, and he wanted to ""make it easier"" for the tower controller who was very busy with arrivals of other airplanes using runways 1L and 1R. The pilot reported that, about 4 miles southwest of the airport, the tower controller cleared him to land on runway 12. Shortly thereafter, the tower controller asked the pilot to ""square off"" his approach. The pilot stated that he selected a higher than normal traffic pattern altitude, due to the limited visibility and terrain located on the west side of the airport. He conducted a visual approach to runway 12, with an increased rate of descent and full flaps. During the landing flare, the airplane floated down the runway, and the pilot executed a go-around, due to insufficient runway distance remaining. He advanced the throttle to maximum (red line), and retracted the flaps to 20°, while increasing the airplane's pitch attitude. As the airplane climbed out, the pilot transmitted on the tower frequency that he was going around. The pilot recalled that the tower controller urgently instructed him twice to ""turn left immediately."" He said that as he initiated the turn to the left, the airplane suddenly stalled, rolled right and descended, impacting the ground in a right wing low attitude. The airplane came to rest on its right side in the grass covered drainage ditch between runways 1L and 1R. The pilot stated that he saw fire through the right window, and immediately went to the back of the airplane to help with the evacuation of the two children and three adult passengers through the left cargo door before the airplane was consumed by fire.08-07-2019",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2019

The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and the first officer was the pilot monitoring (PM). After departure, the aircraft climbed to a cruising altitude of flight level 240. During the flight, the landing runway was changed from runway 30 to runway 20, and finally to runway 12 because of the weather at CYEG, which included a thunderstorm in the area. Once on final approach for runway 12, the flight crew was cleared for a visual approach. The PF planned for and briefed the PM on a flap 15 landing with a VREF speed of 122 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).During the approach phase, the PF added 20 knots to the VREF speed in anticipation of a missed approach, which would involve flying in close proximity to the approaching thunderstorm and possible wind shear. A firm landing was planned due to the potentially gusty conditions on the ground.When the aircraft was 3 nautical miles from CYEG, in level flight at 5000 feet above sea level, the flaps were set to 15°, the landing gear was lowered and the aircrafts airspeed was 142 KIAS, which was the planned VREF speed plus the added 20 knots.At 1713, the aircraft touched down on the main landing gear within the touchdown zone at a speed of 142 KIAS. Shortly after the initial touchdown, the aircrafts weight on wheels sensor indicated that the aircraft had briefly returned to air mode. The PF then made a full nose-down elevator input. A bang and a nose-wheel shimmy followed, and the aircraft pulled to the left as it rolled out on the runway.After landing, the crew consulted the aircrafts integrated communication and application system, and no hard landing indications were noted. The flight crew then taxied the aircraft off runway 12 and onto taxiway A2. Concerned that the aircraft had been damaged during the landing, the flight crew then stopped and requested assistance from maintenance.Due to lightning activity near the airport, shortly after the aircraft had landed, the CYEG duty manager issued a red alert, restricting ground handlers and maintenance personnel from accessing the airfield. Approximately 45 minutes later, the red alert was cancelled and WestJet Encore maintenance personnel attended to the occurrence aircraft. After a brief damage assessment, both nose landing gear tires were changed and the flight crew taxied the aircraft to the terminal gate to disembark the passengers.There were no reported injuries.Given the gusty wind conditions on approach, normal procedures in the WestJet Encore Aircraft Operating Manual called for a target speed of VREF +5 knots, plus half of the gust of 15 knots, or a total of VREF +13 knots. Procedures also called for this speed to be reduced once over the threshold to achieve VREF at touchdown. However, the flight crew planned and flew the approach at VREF +20 knots. The airspeed was not reduced as the aircraft approached the runway threshold and the aircraft touched down at this airspeed.No ICAO Annex 13 Probale Cause statement was issued.19-07-2019",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2019

The first 3 flights were direct flights to the fishing lodge. Because of poor weather conditions in the central coast region, however, all of the flights were delayed.After the crews referred to weather cameras along the central coast region, the flights began to depart, but in a different order than originally scheduled. One of Seairs senior operational staff (operations manager) departed CAM9 at 0850 aboard C-FLAC. The occurrence aircraft departed at 0932.The pilot originally scheduled to fly C-GSAS declined the flight. This pilot had recently upgraded to the Caravan, had never flown to this destination before, and was concerned about the weather at the destination. When Seairs chief pilot returned to CAM9 at 0953 after a series of scheduled flights on a different type of aircraft, he assumed the last remaining flight to the lodge and C-GSAS departed CAM9 at 1024.After departing the Vancouver terminal control area, the occurrence aircraft climbed to 4500 feet above sea level (ASL) and remained at this altitude until 1023, when a slow descent was initiated. The aircraft levelled off at approximately 1300 feet ASL at 1044, when it was approximately 18 NM northeast of Port Hardy Airport (CYZT), BC, and 57 NM southeast of the destination.At 1050, the occurrence aircraft slowly descended again as the flight continued northbound. During this descent, the aircrafts flaps were extended to the 10° position. At this point, the occurrence aircraft was 37 NM south-southeast of the fishing lodge. The aircraft continued to descend until it reached an altitude of approximately 330 feet ASL, at 1056. By this point, the occurrence aircraft was being operated along the coastline, but over the ocean.C-FLAC departed from the fishing lodge at 1056 on the return flight to CAM9. C-FLAC flew into the Fitz Hugh Sound and proceeded southbound along the western shoreline. At approximately 1100, it flew through an area of heavy rain where visibility was reduced to about 1 statute mile (SM). C-FLAC descended to about 170 feet ASL and maintained this altitude for the next 5 minutes before climbing to about 300 feet ASL.As the southbound C-FLAC entered Fitz Hugh Sound from the north at Hecate Island, the occurrence aircraft entered Fitz Hugh Sound from the south, near the southern tip of Calvert Island. The occurrence aircraft then changed course from the western to the eastern shoreline, and descended again to about 230 feet ASL, while maintaining an airspeed of approximately 125 knots.The two aircraft established 2-way radio contact. The pilot of C-FLAC indicated that Addenbroke Island was visible when he flew past it, and described the weather conditions in the Fitz Hugh Sound to the occurrence pilot as heavy rain showers and visibility of approximately 1 SM around Kelpie Point. The occurrence pilot then indicated that he would maintain a course along the eastern shoreline of the sound.At 1103, the two aircraft were separated by 2 NM and passed each other on reciprocal tracks, approximately 4 NM south of the accident site. The occurrence aircraft maintained a consistent track and altitude for the next 54 seconds, then slowly began a 25° change in track to the west (0.35 NM from the Addenbroke Island shoreline). Seven seconds after the turn started (0.12 NM from the islands shoreline), the aircraft entered a shallow climb averaging 665 fpm.At 110455, the occurrence aircraft struck trees on Addenbroke Island at an altitude of approximately 490 feet ASL, at an airspeed of 114 knots, and in a relatively straight and level attitude. The aircraft then continued through the heavily forested hillside for approximately 450 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 425 feet ASL, 9.7 NM east-southeast of the destination fishing lodge.The aircraft was destroyed by the impact forces and the pilot and three of the eight passengers were killed.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The flight departed Vancouver International Water Aerodrome even though the reported and forecast weather conditions in the vicinity of the destination were below visual flight rules minima; the decision to depart may have been influenced by the group dynamics of Seair pilots and senior staff at the flight planning stage.2. The pilot continued flight in reduced visibility, without recognizing the proximity to terrain, and subsequently impacted the rising terrain of Addenbroke Island.3. The configuration of the visual and aural alerting systems and the colouration ambiguity in the primary flight display of the Garmin G1000 was ineffective at alerting the occurrence pilot to the rising terrain ahead.4. The occurrence pilots attention, vigilance, and general cognitive function were most likely influenced to some degree by fatigue.26-07-201926-07-201926-07-2019",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2019

During the pre-flight checks, the flight crew did not identify that there was no pressure in the braking system and did not pressurise this system prior to engine start.Around the time of the start of the final engine in the starting sequence, the aircraft began to roll forward.The dispatcher noticed the aircraft rolling and alerted the crew. The crew attempted to use their foot brakes and the park-brake, however, there was no brake pressure. Around 18 seconds after the aircraft started to roll, it  collided with movable aircraft stairs, which were in front of the Cobham terminal. The stairs struck the front of the aircraft, beneath the right pilot seat. Shortly after, NJW collided with a bollard in front of a light pole, then with the light pole itself.Findings- The crew did not effectively check the brake system pressure during either the originating checklist or the starting checklist. As a result, the crew did not identify that there was no brakepressure prior to engine start. - After engine start, the aircraft inadvertently rolled forward and collided with objects at the edge of the apron. The absence of brake pressure, the slope of the apron and the absence of a nose-wheel chock were contributory to the aircraft rolling forward.- The operator's dispatch practices did not involve placing chocks on the nose-wheel for engine start. Although some ground handling procedures indicated nose-wheel chocks should be used, the operators training did not involve a step to place chocks on aircraft nose-wheels.The absence of a nose-wheel chock fore of the aircraft reduced the defences against the aircraft rolling forward.- The crew had a very limited opportunity to take corrective action before the aircraft collided with objects at the edge of the apron.

When established on the localizer for runway 10R and shortly before leaving 2000 ft on the glide path, the commander through shallow fog obtained visual contact with the runway. The aircraft was configured for landing and became established on the glide slope. The flight was then cleared to land. Prior to reaching an altitude of 500 feet, the aircraft began to descend below the glide slope. When the EGPWS began to sound, warning the crew of their descent below the glide slope, the first officer asked the captain whether to cancel the EGPWS warnings. The captain confirmed. The descent was continued.Approximately 450 m before the beginning of runway 10R the aircraft collided with the antenna mast system of the localizer for runway 28L, which ruptured the left wing fuel tank. After a landing roll of approximately 60 meters, the nose landing gear collided with the near field antenna of the localizer for runway 28L and collapsed. While rolling on the main wheels and skidding on the nose section, the aircraft entered the stopway for runway 28L.The aircraft came to a full stop approximately 230 m after the beginning of runway 10R.

First a return flight to Rackla Airstrip, then a return flight to Rau Airstrip. The pilot completed the first two flights with no issues. The aircraft departed CYMA on the third flight at 0954. A portion of the recorded track was along Granite Creek at an altitude of 4200 feet ASL, which put the aircraft 100 to 200 feet above ground level (AGL) at the highest point along Granite Creek. The aircraft was observed flying eastbound along Granite Creek at low altitude and in reduced visibilities due to rain and cloud at about 1005. The aircraft arrived at Rau Airstrip at 1017, where the cargo was unloaded and different cargo loaded. A passenger boarded the aircraft for the final flight and was seated in the right seat in the cockpit. The aircraft departed Rau Airstrip at 1101.The route of the fourth flight from Rau to CYMA was the reverse of the previous flight. The aircraft entered Granite Creek at 4300 feet ASL and was flying at a ground speed of 156 knots.Eyewitnesses at an exploration camp approximately halfway along Granite Creek heard and then observed the aircraft flying at near tree-top level. The cloud bases to the west of the exploration camp were at tree-top level.As it passed the exploration camp, the aircraft turned south into a box canyon, departing from the intended route. It headed toward rising terrain that led to the north face of Mount Albert. The aircraft began to climb and shortly thereafter was observed to disappear into the clouds and fog at 1112. The aircraft impacted terrain approximately 30 seconds later, in a near wings-level attitude with the flaps in the up position. The 2 occupants were fatally injured on impact. The aircraft was destroyed.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The pilots decision making was influenced by several biases and, as a result, the flight departed and subsequently continued into poor weather conditions in mountainous terrain.2. The high speed at low altitude and low forward visibility reduced the opportunities for the pilot to take alternative action to avoid terrain.3. Within the box canyon, the canyon floor elevation increased abruptly within less than 1 NM and the low visibility prevented the pilot from detecting this and taking sufficient actions to prevent collision with terrain.4. When the pilot turned into the box canyon, the terrain awareness and warning system aural alerts were ineffective in warning the pilot about the rising terrain either because he had already heard multiple similar alerts in the preceding minutes, or because he had silenced the alerts.06-08-2019",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2019

Right after that, the aircraft nose abruptly pitched down and the nose landing gear touched hard on the runway.The aircraft was on the runway centreline and, after the hard touch of the nose landing gear felt and commented by the pilots, it decelerated rapidly. Right after that and still without realizing what had happened, at a speed of approximately 100kt, the pilot in command (Captain) took control of the aircraft.The aircraft, after deceleration, reversed the direction of travel on the runway and headed for the assigned parking space, without anomalies by the crew.During the post-flight walk-around, damage was observed on the lower front fuselage landing gear and on the upper central area in front of the wing.The aircraft suffered damage on the primary fuselage structure with deformed frames, stringers and skin, as well as permanent nose landing gear axle deformation.The Portuguese accident investigation board GPIAAF classified the occurrence as a 'Serious Incident'. By ICAO definitions, rating the occurrence an 'Accident' would seem to be more appropriate as the aircraft sustained damage which ""adversely affects the structural strength [..] of the aircraft"" and required ""major repair"". The aircraft in question was ferried to Atlanta on 19 September, then on to Jacksonville (VQQ) on 13 October. It re-entered service after repairs on December 1, 2019.Probable cause The excessive nose landing gear derotation rate, resulting in a hard landing with nose gear overload.To this event would have contributed the following factors or their combination- the clearance for RNAV (GNSS) approach on runway 12 when the crew have prepared the ILS approach on runway 30;- PF piloting technique with excessive corrections of attitude and thrust corrections, namely the excessive nose down elevator input after MLG touchdown;- For the repeatedly PF corrections, may had contributed the lateral northeast crosswind effect during the landing (050° with 16kt variable between 020° and 080°);- the aircraft's mass on landing contributed to the consequences on the inflicted damage to the primary structure.The engines thrust reduction during the derotation movement, enhancing the excessive moment around the aircraft lateral axis cannot be excluded as a possible contribution factor.18-08-201918-08-2019",International Scheduled Passenger,GPIAAF Portugal ,2019

The seven people onboard were not injured. According to the operator, the airplane was stationed in Malaysia in order to respond to emergencies in the area. It was scheduled for a maintenance C-check and was en route to International Air Responses home base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. The flight had made a refueling stop in Hilo, Hawaii, and another refueling stop in Santa Maria. During those legs of the flight, no problems had been encountered.Prior to takeoff they requested an IFR clearance to visual flight rules (VFR) on top. After they departed from Santa Maria, they contacted Santa Barbara controllers and cancelled their IFR as soon as they broke out of the clouds. Shortly after cancelling IFR, the flight crew heard a loud popping noise, and the passengers heard a loud bang. Simultaneously, the torque gages provided unusual and fluctuating readings. A crew member in the cargo compartment announced misting hydraulic fluid mixed with smoke. The flight crew saw fire-warning lights and other anomalies. The passengers donned their supplemental oxygen and the cockpit crew turned off the four engine bleeds. At this time, they also noticed the utility hydraulic pressure fluctuating and a crew member advised that the landing gear should be lowered before there was a total utility system failure. The landing gear was lowered; the nose and left landing gear lowered, but the right landing gear took longer to lower. The cockpit crew observed three green lights from the landing gear, which indicated the landing gear was lowered and locked. The flight crew turned off the numbers 2 and 4 hydraulic pumps. As they continued to trouble shoot the multiple failures, they diverted to Santa Barbara based on weather considerations, they did not want to return to Santa Maria which would require an ILS approach.The captain declared an emergency and requested radar vectors for terrain clearance when he noticed that the airplane was yawing back and forth. The numbers 3 and 4 fire handles were illuminated, and the number 4 engine was feathered which stopped the yaw of the airplane. During the flight to Santa Barbara, they had to maneuver the airplane over terrain. Once they had cleared the terrain and had the airport in sight, they began their descent. He advised Santa Barbara tower that he would make S-turns to lose altitude as they had no flaps. As a result, their approach speed would be fast, and they would likely use the full length of the runway.As the airplane touched down, he applied full inboard reverse thrust as soon as the nose wheel touched down. The right wing began to drop and the airplane drifted to the right. He applied full left rudder and began using the No. 1 engine reverse to try and keep the airplane on the runway. The airplane continued to the right and departed the right side of the runway. The captain intentionally ground looped the airplane as it was continuing toward the main terminal and parked airplanes. The airplane came to a stop about 270-degrees right of the runway heading.Two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors inspected the airplane and identified the number 3 bleed air duct had failed, which blew hot air onto the surrounding electrical wires and hydraulic lines.25-08-2019",Ferry/positioning,NTSB ,2019

By guiding the aircraft to turn onto the stand during the parking manoeuvre this had resulted in the left wing protruding between two lighting stands located at the southern edge of the stand area. The intention was for the aircraft to continue the turn when taxiing off the stand which would allow its wing to clear the lighting stand in front.The aircraft was unloaded and prepared for its next flight by the flight crew.

Five historic WWII aircraft were on display at Bradley Airport and scenic flights were carried out. The B-17 carried a military livery as ""42-31909"" and named ""Nine O Nine"". The local flight had received clearance for departure from runway 06 at 0947 hours local time. After takeoff the aircraft made a right-hand turn. At 0949 the aircraft contacted the Bradley Tower controller and reported an engine no.4 problem (""rough mag"") and asked permission to land on runway 06. This was approved.The controller then instructed the pilot to fly a right downwind leg for runway 6 and confirmed that the flight needed an immediate landing. He subsequently cancelled the approach of another airplane and advised the pilot to proceed however necessary to runway 6. The approach controller instructed the pilot to contact the tower controller, which he did.The tower controller reported that the wind was calm and cleared the flight to land on runway 6. The pilot acknowledged the landing clearance; at that time, the airplane was about 400 ft agl on a midfield right downwind leg for runway 6. The tower controller asked about the airplane's progress to the runway and the pilot replied that they were ""getting there"" and on the right downwind leg. No further communications were received from the accident airplane. The airplane struck approach lights about 1000 ft prior to the runway, then contacted the ground about 500 ft prior to the runway before reaching runway 6. It then veered right off the runway before colliding with vehicles and a deicing fluid tank about 1100 ft right of the center of the runway threshold.The wreckage came to rest upright and the majority of the cabin, cockpit, and right wing were consumed by postimpact fire.An investigation of the wreckage showed that all three propeller blades on the no. 4 engine appeared in the feather position. The no.3 engine had one propeller blade that was near the feather position. The other two blades appeared in a position between low pitch and feather.It was also found that the No. 4 engines left magneto produced a strong spark on the ignition leads for all nine cylinders, but that the grounding tab contacted the housing, causing the magneto to short and not function during a postaccident test. The No. 4 engines right magneto produced no spark on one of the nine ignition leads and a weak and intermittent spark on the other eight ignition leads because of wear to the compensator cam. The shorted-out left magneto would have caused rough engine operation and a partial loss of engine power that would have been exacerbated by the weak right magneto, which is likely what prompted the pilot to shut down the No. 4 engine and return to the airport.With the No. 4 engine shut down, the pilot would have had to use a higher power setting for the No. 3 engine to compensate for the loss of power from the No. 4 engine. Teardown examination of the No. 3 engine revealed evidence of detonation on four of the nine cylinders. In addition, the teardown examination revealed that the spark plugs were worn and had gaps between the electrodes that were beyond the manufacturers specifications. The condition of the spark plugs likely resulted in detonation and a partial loss of engine power that further reduced the total thrust available and exacerbated the thrust asymmetry. The pilot had performed a preflight run-up check of the magnetos at an engine speed of 1,700 rpm, which was higher than the 1,600-rpm speed in the Collings Foundations run-up checklist; after the check, the magnetos appeared to perform normally. However, a B-17 engine ground test checklist included instructions to check the magnetos at an engine speed between 1,900 and 2,000 rpm. If the pilots had been required to perform the magneto check at the higher rpm, they might have detected the detonation on the No. 3 engine and/or the magneto anomalies on the No. 4 engine.Probable cause ""The pilots failure to properly manage the airplanes configuration and airspeed after he shut down the No. 4 engine following its partial loss of power during the initial climb. Contributing to the accident was the pilot/maintenance directors inadequate maintenance while the airplane was on tour, which resulted in the partial loss of power to the Nos. 3 and 4 engines; the Collings Foundations ineffective safety management system (SMS), which failed to identify and mitigate safety risks; and the Federal Aviation Administrations inadequate oversight of the Collings Foundations SMS.""02-10-201902-10-201902-10-201902-10-201902-10-201902-10-201902-10-2019",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2019

Fog had reduced the visibility at the touchdown zone to 150 meters with a vertical visibility of 50 m.At 0340 the flight reported capturing the localizer and the controller reported visibility had increased to 800 m at the touchdown zone and a vertical visibility of 60 m.After the flight was cleared to land, the aircraft descended significantly below the glide slope. At a distance of 3,3 km from the runway, the aircraft had descended to an altitude of 100 meters. At an altitude of 60 meters, an alarm sounded that the decision height had been reached, to which no crew member responded. At a distance of 1359 meters from the runway threshold, at an altitude of 5-7 meters, the aircraft collided with trees and crashed.CausesThe most probable cause of the accident, collision of a serviceable aircraft with the ground during the landing approach in a dense fog, was the crews failure to perform the flight in the instrument conditions due to the probable physical excessive fatigue, which led to an unconscious descent of the aircraft below the glide path and ground impact.Contributing FactorsProbable exceeding the aircraft takeoff weight during departure from the Vigo Airport, which could result in increase in consumption of the fuel, the remainder of which did not allow to perform the flight to the alternate Boryspil aerodrome.04-10-201904-10-201904-10-201904-10-201904-10-201904-10-2019May 196887Soviet Air Force199287Ukraine Air Force1995UR-11314Lviv Airlines12 December 2006ER-AXXAeronordJuly 2007UR-CAHMeridian2012UR-CAHUkraine Air Alliance",Cargo,NBAAI Ukraine ,2019

The aircraft departed Anchorage, Alaska, USA at 1515 hours local time, bound for Unalaska. As the flight descended towards Unalaska, it was cleared for the RNAV runway 13 approach. During the descent and approach the wind changed from 210 degrees at 8 knots, gusting to 14 knots, to 180 degrees at 7 knots. During the approach, the winds were reported as 270 degrees at 10 knots.A go-around was executed as the aircraft was not stabilized on the approach, The flight returned for a visual approach to runway 13. Winds increased and during the second approach the controller reported winds of 300 degrees at 24 knots. At 1740 the aircraft touched down about 1,000 feet down the 4,500 feet long runway and the captain initiated reverse thrust and normal wheel-braking. The captain stated that he went to maximum braking around the 80 knot call. The flight crew reported that they attempted to steer the airplane to the right at the end of the runway to avoid going into the water. The airplane then departed the runway and overrun area, traversed a section of grass, impacted a 3- to 4-ft high chain-linked perimeter fence with evidence of left engine propeller contact, crossed a ditch, impacted a large rock, and crossed a public roadway. The left wing or left engine propeller struck a 4 to 5 ft vertical signal post on the opposite shoulder of the road and the left propeller struck a 6 to 8-ft high yellow diamond shaped road sign. The left hand prop shattered, sending pieces into and through the fuselage. One propeller blade was found inside the fuselage. Two people were critically injured. One passenger died of injuries the next day.The the probable cause of this accident was the landing gear manufacturer's incorrect wiring of the wheel speed transducer harnesses on the left MLG during overhaul. The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplane's braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab's design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the FAA's lack of consideration of the RSA dimensions at DUT during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers' inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer's limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir's failure to correctly apply its company-designated PIC airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir's route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000.?17-10-201917-10-201917-10-201917-10-201917-10-201917-10-201917-10-201917-10-201917-10-20199 April 1995SE-017Saab12 June 1995V7-9508Air Marshall IslandsMarch 1998V7-9508Air Vanuatu11 April 2000F-GJIGRegional Airlines22 June 2000LX-DBREurope Air Charter29 Oct. 2001F-GOAJAir Jet23 December 2004SE-017Saab10 Apr 2005N519JGJoe Gibbs Racing10 May 2016N686PAPenAir",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,NTSB ,2019

This space is not normally used by the CC-150, and the D-14 tow tractor normally used is too large for the limited space available inside 10 hangar. Before entering the hangar, the ground crew were required to stop and swap the tow tractor from the bigger D-14 to the smaller D-12.Once the aircraft reached a position in front of 10 hangar, the tow crew stopped the aircraft, set the chocks and the parking brake. During the tow tractor change, while no tractor was attached, the aircraft started moving forward and over the chocks. Attempts to stop the aircraft by the tow crew were unsuccessful. The right engine struck the D-12 tow tractor parked inside the hangar, before the nose contacted the hangar far wall structure, finally stopping the aircraft. The aircraft sustained very serious damage.The investigation could not positively determine the cause for the parking brake not holding the aircraft in position. However, it was found that the chocks used to secure the aircraft were not authorized in the Technical Support Arrangement and not all wheels had chocks at the time of the accident.

Al 167 passengers and nine crew members on board were killed.The Boeing 737-800, registration UR-PSR, had landed on schedule at 0057 hours local time at Tehran. The return leg back to Kiev was due to depart at 0515 local time (0145 UTC). In the meantime, around 0215 hours local time in Iran, numerous ballistic missiles were fired from Iran towards U.S. bases in Iraq in response to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani by a United States drone strike.As a result this military operation changed the alertness level of Iran's air defense. At approximately 0400 the military sector informed the civil sector of the country's Airspace Control that only the flights already detected and cleared for flight operations by the defense network could be permitted to start up. This would ensure the correct identification of civil flights by the defense network and avoiding targeting them by mistake.At 0549 the doors were closed and the aircraft was ready to depart. Two minutes later the flight requested the to start up the engines.After contacting the Area Control Center, the ATC unit requested clearance for the Ukrainian flight at 0552. The Area Control Center forwarded the request for flight PS752 to the Air Defense Coordination Center, which subsequently issued the clearance accordingly.The aircraft then taxied to runway 29R and commenced the takeoff roll at 0611. After takeoff the flight contacted Mehrabad Radar and was cleared to climb to FL260 and turn right after reaching 6000 feet, heading direct to the PAROT reporting point.As the aircraft was climbing after departure, it appeared on the air defense system. However, a wrong initialisation procedure of the system's north alignment had induced a 107-degree error in the system. Thus, the direction of objects and targets detected by this system was being observed with an increase of 107 degrees by the operator.At 061356, the air defense unit operator detected a target at his 250-degree azimuth, flying on a 52-degree course. At the same time, PS752 had been flying towards the defense system from a 143-degree azimuth. The aircraft was flying a 309-degree course.At 061421, the operator notified the specifications of the detected target to the Coordination Center over the communication network.  The notification was not communicated successfully.Meanwhile the system operator began analyzing the observable information and categorized the detected target as a threat. At 061441, without receiving any response from the Coordination Center, the air defense unit operator fired a missile at the threatening target he had detected. Under the applicable procedures, if the defense system operator cannot establish communication with the Coordination Center and does not receive the fire command, they are not authorized to fire. The missile radio fuse was activated at 061459. At that point flight PS752 was at 8100 feet at a position about 20 km west-northwest of the airport.After the first missile radio fuse was activated, the air defense unit radar still locked on the target, and the defense system kept detecting and tracking it. By observing the continuity of trajectory of detected target, the second missile was fired at the aircraft by the operator of defense system at 061511.At 064524, the last communication between the missile and the defense system was recorded in a place close to the aircraft route. After that, the defense system showed a message indicating the strike had failed, with the aircraft clearing from the radar lock-on after some time.The aircraft turned to the right and about 061611, a fire broke out on the aircraft, which was intensifying. Altitude was lost and at 061823, the aircraft crashed into a playground in Khalajabad near Shahedshahr area, 15 km north of the airport. It disintegrated completely and wreckage was strewn along a 300 m long path.Cause of the AccidentThe air defense's launching two surface-to-air missiles at the flight PS752, UR-PSR aircraft the detonation of the first missile warhead in proximity of the aircraft caused damage to the aircraft systems and the intensification of damage led the aircraft to crash into the ground and explode instantly.Other Contributing Factors- The mitigating measures and defense layers in risk management proved to be ineffective due to the occurrence of an unanticipated error in threat identifications, and ultimately failed to protect the flight safety against the threats caused by the alertness of defense forces.08-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-202008-01-2020",International Scheduled Passenger,AAIB Iran ,2020

The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 36C at Antalya Airport. During the base leg of the approach, the autopilot and autothrottle were disengaged. The aircraft was further configured for landing and the approach was stabled at 1035 feet altitude, 3 nm and from the runway.When descending below 270 feet (about 100ft agl) the airspeed decreased below the approach speed of 122 kt to a value to 109 at 20 feet above the runway. The pitch was 5.5° nose-up and idle thrust was selected.Then the captain abruptly moved the sidestick fully forward, holding it there for 1.5 seconds and causing the nose to drop. Full power was added and its nose-gear struck the runway with a 2.64g impact. The Airbus bounced and the captain pulled the sidestick to execute a go-around. The aircrafts flight-control system switched to direct law, two inertial reference systems failed, and attitude indications disappeared from the captains instruments. Although the flaps were partially retracted during the go-around, the undercarriage could not be retracted.Smoke entered the cockpit and the flight declared a Mayday. Subsequently a low pass was made over runway 36C so the Tower could assess the damage to the aircraft. Then a dual hydraulic failure occurred, and the fight again declared a Mayday. A left-hand visual approach was flown to runway 36C and the aircraft landed. The runway was vacated and the aircraft was then shut down.The airline only notified the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee on January 14, four days after the accident. Investigators believes that after the accident both the voice recorder (CVR) as well as the flight data recorder (FDR) were removed by RMS Technic in Antalya. The voice recorder was fitted to a second Airbus A321 (VP-BHN) flying the return service to Moscow. After arrival in Moscow, it was removed by another maintenance firm and transported back to RMS Technic in Antalya where the recorder was refitted to the original damaged A321, before the inquiry team arrived.The investigation is ongoing.10-01-202010-01-202010-01-202010-01-2020",Ferry/positioning,MAK ,2020

The airplane ended up 400 or 500 yards offshore in the waters of Unalaska Bay near Hog Island and sank. The three occupants were rescued.According to the pilot, after checking the weather on the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), he completed the before takeoff check list, back taxied for a runway 31 departure and initiated the takeoff roll. He said he recalled the winds being reported as 100° at 9 knots. As the airplane accelerated down the runway, he said the airspeed was about 75 knots at midfield and increasing. When the airspeed reached about 90 knots, he applied back pressure to the control yoke to initiate the takeoff and noted a brief positive rate of climb, followed by a sinking sensation. The airspeed rapidly decayed, and the stall warning horn sounded. In an effort to correct for the decaying airspeed, he lowered the nose and immediately noticed the airplane's lights reflecting off the surface of the water. He pulled back on the airplane's control yoke and leveled the wings just before impacting the ocean waters.

The aircraft had departed Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport (CYUL) at 0706 hours local time on a multi-stop flight to Salluit. The accident occurred on the second leg, from Montréal to Schefferville.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. The pilots forgot to perform the descent checklist and realized this at an inopportune time, when the pilot monitoring was providing a position report.2. Given the ambiguities and contradictions in the stabilized approach guidelines, the captain interpreted that he was allowed to continue the approach below 500 feet above aerodrome elevation although the flaps had not been set to 35° and the final checklist had not been completed.3. Communicating with the flight attendant to confirm the cabin status and performing the descent checklist during final approach added to the pilots workload, which was already heavy.4. The combination of the visual conditions and the plan continuation bias prompted the pilots to continue managing the height and speed deviations past the stabilized approach gate.5. When the aircraft passed 500 feet above aerodrome elevation, the pilots, who were dealing with a heavy workload, passed the stabilized approach gate without noticing it and continued the approach, which was de facto unstable.6. At the time of the flare, the aircraft no longer had enough energy to stop the rate of descent solely by increasing the pitch attitude.7. The instinctive reaction to increase the pitch attitude, combined with the hard landing, resulted in the aft fuselage striking the runway, causing major damage to the aircrafts structure.",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2020

The three occupants were killed and the aircraft was destroyed.The Citation departed Port Elizabeth Airport (FAPE) on a positioning flight to George Airport (FAGG). On approach to FAGG, the flying crew requested to carry out a calibration flight for the very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at FAGG. Due to inclement weather conditions at the time, they were not cleared to conduct VOR calibration. As a result, they decided to land and refuel the aircraft before commencing with the calibration of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 11 at FAGG. The flying crew requested take-off from runway 11 and an early right turn to intercept radial 250°, 17 nautical miles (nm) DME arc to radial 330° at 3000 feet (ft) climbing to 4000ft. The air traffic control (ATC) granted their request.Radar data indicated that at 1042, the aircraft took off from runway 11 and, once airborne, made a right-hand turn to intercept radial 250° using the George VOR (GRV VOR). The aircraft climbed to 3000ft. Once the aircraft reached 17nm on the DME from the GRV VOR (DME is co-located with the VOR), it commenced with a right-hand turn to intercept radial 330° while maintaining 17nm DME arc.At 1046, the ATC at FAGG advised the flying crew that they were now exiting controlled airspace and were advised to broadcast on the special rules frequency. The crew acknowledged the advisory to change frequency and there was no further communication. The aircraft was still being monitored by ATC using secondary surveillance radar.At 1050, radar data showed the aircraft crossing radial 310° and entered a climb from 3000ft, reaching 3900ft. As the aircraft levelled off at 3900ft, a rapid descent occurred, and the aircraft lost 1500ft in approximately 9 seconds.

The aircraft stopped 90 meters beyond the paved end of the runway stopway in the middle of a road. All occupants safely evacuated the aircraft.The aircraft took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 0624 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL320. The flight was subsequently cleared direct to GODMO. After contacting the controller at Mahshahr the crew was informed ""runway active is 31; wind is now 280/08kts, CAVOK, temperature +06, DP 04 and QNH 1023, expected VOR approach runway 31 via GODMO 1E Arrival"".The flight responded by requesting runway 13 for landing. ATC then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 13 using the GODMO 1F Arrival procedure.At 073041 local time, the pilot reported over position GODMO at FL100. ATC replied ""CPN 6936 yes sir; descend as profile to MNM 2000 feet for VOR/DME APP RWY 13, report when leaving IAF and cleared approach.""At 073246, the pilot reported leaving the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) MNM. At that time the aircraft was flying at an altitude at 6647 ft instead of 2000 ft as required.The controller cleared the flight to land. As the aircraft passed 2500 ft, the autopilot was disengaged. Then the captain decided to control altitude and speed by executing an S-turn maneuver several times and continued in visual reference with the ground.At 073529, at altitude 934 ft, the captain asked the copilot to set speed and the copilot called out the target airspeed of 135 knots when the actual speed (IAS) at the time was 196 kt. Upon receiving EGPWS Sink Rate warnings, the copilot warned the pilot to read the landing checklist, but the captain did not accept this and accomplished an unstabilized high-speed approach for the purpose of landing. The copilot claimed in his statement after the accident that ""I wanted to take control of the aircraft and follow missed approach procedure but due to pilot over-confidence to overcome present situation and age gap, I disregarded it."" The captain was a 64-year old pilot with over 18000 flying hours, compared to the 28-year old copilot who had 300 hours.From 1000 ft until 10 ft altitude, sink rate and pull up warnings sounded in the cockpit successively.Finally, at 073611, the aircraft landed with high speed (171 kt) after passing two-thirds of the runway. It touched down nosegear-first and bounced. Full auto thrust reversers and brakes were applied.

At the time of the accident the aircraft operated on a combat sortie as well as a Mission Qualification Training for the first officer.Takeoff occurred at 1105 local time. The flight proceeded to the assigned orbit using standard departure/climb procedures. The crew assumed a circular orbit just west of Kabul at 42,000 feet altitude at about 1136. At 1250, the crew requested and was cleared by ATC to climb from 42,000 feet altitude to 43,000 feet altitude. The engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) advanced and the crew initiated the climb with the autopilot, gaining about 300 feet. At 125052, a fan blade broke free and separated from the N1 first-stage turbofan of the left engine, causing major damage and resulting in the immediate shutdown of that engine by the Electronic Engine Controller (EEC), a subsystem of the Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC). This was accompanied by a bang. Simultaneous with the bang, the CVR recording stopped. Within one to two seconds after the initial event, the autothrottles disengaged automatically. The autopilot was engaged and it remained engaged. Bank angles remained essentially constant, consistent with a circular orbit, and the aircraft descended from an altitude of 42,300 feet to 41,000 feet.Ten seconds after the catastrophic left engine failure, the crew retarded both throttles to just less than halfway (14 degrees; total throttle range is from 0  40 degrees) for one second, then slightly advancing the left throttle separately (26 degrees) for one second, then retarding it to align with the right throttle (both at 16 degrees) for one second, and finally splitting the throttles to advance the left throttle (to 31 degrees) while retarding the right to idle (0 degrees).Nine seconds after moving the right throttle to idle, the crew placed the right engine run switch to off, shutting down the right engine. Finally, at 125119, the left throttle was advanced to full power (40 degrees), briefly cycled then brought to idle. At 125123, both throttles were advanced from idle to full power.It is likely the crews first actions, including the shutdown, were hastened by a sense of urgency due to aircraft vibrations and other auditory/sensory cues, reinforced by the startle response.The crew announced to Kabul ATC that they had lost both engines and that they intended to proceed to Kandahar, which was well outside the E-11A glide capabilities.This intent suggests that the crew was confident of airstarting one or both engines.While the crew would have waited, in accordance with the checklist, to 30,000 feet to attempt an airstart, an airstart of the right engine should have been successful, whether accomplished with windmilling airspeed or with the assistance of the APU. However, airstarts of the left engine would have failed due to the original damage. There is no DFDR data to definitively confirm whether an engine airstart attempt was made.At 130330, the crew announced to ATC that they were going to land at FOB Sharana. The aircraft continued to glide without engine power and was not able to reach Sharana.At approximately 1309, the aircraft impacted the ground approximately 21 NM (39 km) short of Sharana, on a heading of roughly 140 degrees, consistent with a direct flight path towards Sharana. The terrain was unpopulated, largely flat, and covered in snow. The wings show the slats out and the flaps appear to be extended, suggesting that the aircraft had been configured for, and presumably slowed for, landing. It is likely that the crew attempted to make a forced landing.While the terrain was largely flat, the aircraft impacted berms and ditches, roughly estimated between 3-6 feet high. Weather at Sharana was reported to have 1000 foot ceilings, and pilot testimony confirms approximately 1000 foot ceilings in the vicinity of the accident site. Accordingly, the crew may have had less than a minute to maneuver after exiting the clouds and seeing the terrain. It appears that while the aircraft touched down, it impacted a smaller berm almost immediately, then more completely impacted the ground and skidded to a halt in approximately 340 meters. During this time the wings were ripped from the aircraft, and subsequently much of the cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire.The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found by a preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was the MCs error in analyzing which engine had catastrophically failed (left engine). This error resulted in the MCs decision to shutdown the operable right engine creating a dual engine out emergency.The AIB President also found by a preponderance of the evidence that the MCs failure to airstart the right engine and their decision to recover the MA to KAF substantially contributed to the mishap.27-01-2020",Military,USAF AIB ,2020

It was snowing at the time of the accident. During the landing roll on runway 33, the aircraft departed the cleared area of the runway to the left, contacted a windrow, travelled partially off the runway surface, returned to the runway and stopped. The damage to the aircraft included the nose wheel collapsing and damage to the right propeller blades.The aircraft was ferried to Kelowna on May 27 and resumed service after final repairs on June 10, 2020.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Given the falling snow and the snow-covered runway, there were limited visual cues available to the flight crew, which decreased their ability to accurately judge the aircrafts lateral position once it was beyond the threshold.2. Snow clearing operations cleared the centre 100 feet of the runway, which resulted in windrows that were approximately 18 inches high along the edges of the cleared area. This reduced the pilots lateral manoeuvring room during the landing.3. The aircraft initially touched down 10 feet left of the centreline due to control inputs and variable wind conditions and, while the aircraft was still in a light weight-on-wheels condition, a gust contributed to a further deviation to the left until the left main landing gear came into contact with the windrow.4. As the left main landing gear impacted the windrow, the drag on that landing gear caused the aircraft to pull to the left, causing the nose and right main landing gear to also come into contact with the windrow.5. During the runway excursion, snow and ice became packed in the nose landing gear bay and caused structural deformation. Consequently, the nose landing gear was no longer being held in place and collapsed rearward into the fuselage, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.31-01-202031-01-2020",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2020

Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight plan was filed. The flight originated from HPB, about 1558, and was destined for Bethel, Alaska (BET).According to the captain, the weather conditions the day of the accident consisted of snow, low visibility, and flat light. The original flight departure time had been delayed about 3 hours due to weather. The scheduled route of flight was from Bethel (BET), to Scammon Bay (SCM), to HPB, to Chevak (VAK), returning to BET with various passengers and cargo pick-ups and drop-offs along the route. Prior to departure from BET he received runway reports from his dispatcher that all destination airport runways were ready. He also obtained weather at all three destinations. He then did a risk analysis and gathered more weather before deeming the flight conditions good to dispatch the flight.While enroute to HPB he gathered weather for VAK and determined that the VAK portion of the flight would be canceled due to deteriorating weather. Once in HPB he landed without incident on the snow covered runway. He then called Grant dispatch in BET and informed that he would take all the passengers going to BET since he had canceled his flight to VAK; he loaded 7 passengers total and their bags.

There were 183 occupants on the aircraft. Three passengers died, the remaining 180 occupants were injured.The aircraft departed Izmir Airport at 1722 hours. At the time the flight arrived in the vicinity of  Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen Airport, a thunderstorm was passing. Runway in use was 06. About 1817 the Tower controller cleared another flight for takeoff from runway 06, reporting wind 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The subsequent arrival was flight 2193, which was cleared to land with wind information given as 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 30 knots. This translates to a 19 knot tailwind.Since the wind was shifting the controller reported to a flight on the ground that it was to expect a runway change for departure.At 1819 Pegasus 2193 touched down, but failed to come to a complete stop on the runway. It overran and went down an embankment, breaking in three. The aircraft came to rest about 30 m below runway elevation.Data from flight tracking website Flightradar24 suggest that the aircraft was steered to the left at the end of the runway, likely as there was an antenna array just past the stopway. The last recorded ground speed was 63 knots as the aircraft crossed the perimeter road.Runway 06 is a concrete runway with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 3000 m. At the runway end there is a 65 m long stopway, followed by antenna array, perimeter road and a downslope.In March 2020 Turkish media reported on a preliminary report, issued by authorities. According to this report the aircraft was struck by lightning six minutes before landing. During the approach one of the preceding aircraft reported a sudden tailwind of 37 knots below 600 feet. This report was communicated in Turkish by the Tower controller. The Dutch first officer, who was Pilot Monitoring, did not understand this. Subsequent clearances and weather information were in English.After touchdown the speedbrake and autobrake activated. The thrust reversers were selected manually. After passing taxiway F at an airspeed of 57 knots, the speed brake and thrust reverser were switched off. The ground speed was reported to be 84 knots due to the effect of the wind. Six seconds later manual braking was resumed.The aircraft failed to stop on the runway, hit ILS antennas and a small building before it fell 30 m down the embankment.05-02-202005-02-2020D-ABKDBoeing23 January 2009D-ABKDAir Berlin17 February 2009EI-FNDSMBC Aviation Capital19 April 2016TC-IZKIZair, operating for Pegasus Airlines11 May 2016TC-IZKPegasus Airlines30 December 2018",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,,2020

There were no injuries among the 166 passengers.The captain on the flight from Berlin Tegel Airport was the Pilot Flying (PF). The flight had been uneventful, although the flight crew was aware of unfavourable weather conditions in Keflavik with winds around 40 knots, gusting to 53-56 knots.Flight 529 was cleared direct to NONBO by Keflavik Approach. The captain briefed his intentions to land a bit further down the runway than normal (3 white and 1 red on the PAPI), to avoid turbulence on short final. When the airplane reached NONBO, it intercepted the localizer and the ILS was followed down towards runway 10.The airplane encountered considerable turbulence at 1000 feet above MSL. The autopilot was disengaged between 600 and 700 feet above MSL and the airplane was then manually flown down towards the runway. The airplane was flown with the nose into the wind on final approach due to crosswind conditions. Few seconds before touchdown the airplane was de-crabbed to line up with the runway heading.The flare was normal and the airplane initially touched down on its right main landing gear. Then the left main landing gear touched the runway. Almost immediately thereafter, as the nose was gradually coming down, abnormal sound was observed and the right side of the airplane sunk down.The airplane speedbrake deployed momentarily and the right engine hit the runway. The airplane then leveled off again and the nose landing gear touched the runway. The airplane wobbled as it continued down the runway, on the left main landing gear and the nose landing gear only, as the PF fought to keep the airplane level and centered on the runway, utilizing the aileron and rudder controls. As the airplane speed decreased, the aerodynamics of the wings and the effectiveness of the rudder and aileron control diminished, until the PF could no longer keep the airplane wings level. The right wing sunk down again and the right engine hit the runway again. The airplane skid on the runway until it came to stop, still on the runway but with a magnetic heading of 115°. During the on-site investigation it became clear that the nut used to fasten the swivel in the lug position on the main landing gear shock strut was missing along with its mating washer-splined. These parts were found on the runway where the touchdown occurred.Further investigation showed that the swivel threads were undersized 1/16 inch during an overhaul in December 2008. The SWIVEL threads were then undersized again during an overhaul in November 2019, bringing it to 1/8 inch undersize. Such an undersize was allowed but required a special 1/8 undersized nut to be fabricated and used. However, the nut on TF-FIA was found to be too large.07-02-202007-02-2020",International Scheduled Passenger,TSB Iceland ,2020

Tune Airport, Tennessee around 1022. Then, another flight plan was filed back to Peachtree Airport departing at 1030 and arriving around 1119. In addition, the flight plan noted in the remarks section that the flight was a ""training flight.""The pilot in command, seated in the right seat, among others held a flight instructor certificate. He was also type rated in the Cessna 500. The second in command, seated in the left seat, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. The pilot was scheduled to attend flight training to obtain a Cessna 500 type rating.After departure the controller issued local weather information and instructed the pilots to climb to 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The controller issued the pilots a pilot report (PIREP) for trace to light rime icing between 9,000 ft and 11,000 ft, and one of the pilots acknowledged. Then, the controller instructed the pilots to climb to 10,000 ft and to turn right to 020°. The controller observed the airplane on a northwest bound heading and asked the pilots to verify their heading. A pilot responded that they were returning to a 320° heading, to which the controller instructed him to maintain 10,000 ft. The controller asked the pilots if everything was alright, and a pilot responded that they had a problem with the autopilot. The controller instructed the pilots to again maintain 10,000 ft and to advise when they were able to accept a turn. The controller again asked if everything was alright or if they needed assistance; however, neither pilot responded. The controller again asked the pilots if everything was under control and if they required assistance, to which one of the pilots replied that they were ""OK now.""The airplane climbed to 10,500 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and again asked if everything was under control. A pilot responded in the affirmative and stated that they were ""playing with the autopilot"" because they were having trouble with it, and the controller suggested that they turn off the autopilot and hand-fly the airplane. The airplane descended to 9,000 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and asked them if they could return to the departure airport to resolve the issues. One of the pilots requested a higher altitude to get into visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, and the controller instructed him to climb to 12,000 ft, advised that other aircraft reported still being in the clouds at 17,000 ft, and asked their intentions. The pilot requested to continue to their destination and the controller instructed him to climb to 13,000 ft.One of the pilots established communication with another controller at 11,500 ft and stated they were climbing to 13,000 ft on a 360° heading. The controller instructed the pilot to climb to 16,000 ft and inquired if their navigation issues were corrected. A pilot advised the controller that they had problems with the left side attitude indicator and that they were working off the right side. The controller cleared the airplane direct to the destination airport and asked if they were above the clouds as they were climbing through 15,400 ft. The airplane then began a left turn and soon after radar contact was lost at 1013. The main wreckage of the airplane was located around 1330 on the day of the accident. It came to rest in a wooded area, inverted, and partially submerged in a creek at an elevation of 703 ft mean sea level. Several parts of the airplane were not located in the vicinity of the main wreckage but were in the wooded area surrounding the main wreckage, consistent with an inflight breakup.

The pilot and the one passenger were not injured. The airplane was climbing through flight level (FL) 225 for FL 380, when the pilot heard a ""loud crashing noise"" followed by a ""turbulent air sound"" he described as similar to flying with the main landing gear extended. At time of the initial noise, the pilot reported the airplane was on a heading of 255, the airspeed was about 265 to 270 kts, and the autopilot system was engaged. The autopilot system was set to lateral navigation and the vertical speed was set for 1,500 ft per minute for climbing. The pilot reacted to the initial noise by disconnecting the autopilot system, announcing the issue to air traffic control (ATC), slowing down the airplane to 170 kts, and descending to 11,000 ft above mean sea level. There were no master caution or warning lights illuminated on the cockpit annunciation panel. The pilot initially thought the airplane had a main landing gear malfunction based of the sound of the airflow around the cabin. The pilot slowed the airplane further, cycled the main landing gear, cycled the flaps, and moved the flight controls. He reported everything checked out normal except the ""turbulent air sound"" which was exacerbated with rudder movement. The pilot decided the main landing gear was functioning normally and there was a problem with the empennage.The pilot located the closest airport with a paved runway greater than a 5,000 ft length, contacted ATC, and proceeded to land at the Mineral Wells Airport (MWL), Texas.

The pilot flying the aircraft was undergoing route and airstrip training. He was occupying the left seat and was Pilot Under Instruction (PUI). The pilot in the right seat was the instructor pilot for MAF conducting route and airstrip training for the new pilot.The pilot crossed overhead of the airstrip for an inspection of the surface and wind conditions. The crew did not observe any standing water or any wet areas on the strip. They also reported that the windsock indicated calm winds and the strip was clear.The aircraft joined mid-downwind less than half a nautical mile from the airstrip and tracked North West, descending from 1200 ft to 1000 ft before turning onto base. The aircraft began descending as it turned to line up on the final approach profile. There was a tailwind component of 5-12 kt on base and final. The aircraft overshot the turn onto final approach, 1.8 nm from the threshold at 900 ft. The pilot established the aircraft on the approach profile 1 nm from the threshold and at about 500 ft.The instructor stated that during final approach, the aircraft had descended below the normal approach profile causing him to instruct the pilot to adjust power and aim point to get back onto the correct profile.The pilot commenced the flare just under 20 ft AGL, 78 kt (85 kt ground speed).The aircraft touched down with an airspeed of 77 kt (82 kt ground speed) 36 m past the runway 11 threshold. The pilot stated that a few seconds after touchdown, he applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left. According to tyre track approximations, the aircraft appeared to have deviated about 220 m up-strip from threshold. The pilot stated that he applied full right rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back towards the center of the strip. The aircraft turned back to the right and rolled parallel to the centerline for another 100 m before it swerved left again, diverging at a 30° angle from the centerline. It rolled for 60 m as it bogged into the soft ground. The propeller blades subsequently struck the ground and the aircraft turned sharply left causing it to tip onto its starboard side.The crew reported that there were no injuries sustained during the accident and subsequent evacuation.Causes [Contributing factors]Onlanding,the PUI applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left of the centerline. Rudder was applied to get the aircraft back onto centerline, however, the rudder was not effective to counter the effect of reverse thrust as the left wheel entered in a softened area of the strip surface, which resulted in the aircraft being unable to regain the centerline as the landing roll progressed.The PUI did not effectively manage the effect of torque to maintain centerline during the landing roll. The PUIs limited experience level on the aircraft type, low proficiency level in the use of reverse thrust during landing rolls, soft strip surface and soil condition were contributing factors of the accident.14-02-202014-02-202014-02-2020",Domestic Non Scheduled Passenger,AIC PNG ,2020

The decision was made to abandon the approach, and the crew received clearance from ATC to proceed NW of the CYYC airport and troubleshoot the issue. The crew executed the applicable QRH procedure and subsequently received clearance from ATC to proceed with the landing. A flaps 0 landing was then executed. During the landing roll, after ground spoiler and thrust reverser deployment, the nose of the aircraft attained a significant nose high attitude. The rear fuselage of the aircraft struck the runway, and during the recovery, the nose landing gear subsequently impacted the runway. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and to the intended parking area. Subsequent inspectionrevealed that the aircraft sustained significant structural damage to the forward fuselage and minor damage to the rear fuselage. There were no injuries.Findings as to causes and contributing factors1. Moisture entered the flap flexible drive shaft casing, likely through the undetected puncture holes and the drive shaft casing to flap actuator interface, which led to the subsequent corrosion and failure of the inner drive shaft.2. As the occurrence aircrafts actual annual utilization was approximately half of that expected by the manufacturer, the calendar time interval between maintenance inspections increased. As a result, the corrosion that developed was not detected because the shaft had not yet reached the 2400 flight-hour maintenance interval.3. The Challenger 605 flight simulator used for recurrent training did not accurately represent the zero-flap handling characteristics of the aircraft when the thrust reversers are deployed, nor was it required for certification. As a result, the flight crew was inadequately prepared to prevent, or recover from, the nose pitch-up that occurred when the thrust reversers were deployed.4. The pilot monitoring did not read the cautions included on the flaps fail checklist out loud to the pilot flying during the completion of the Quick Reference Handbook procedure. As a result, information critical to the safe operation of the aircraft was not brought to the pilot flyings attention.5. Insufficient pressure was applied to the control column to maintain the nose on the runway while using maximum reverse thrust; as a result, the nose pitched up, the aft fuselage contacted the runway, and the aircraft transitioned to a partial weight-off-wheels state.6. When the left main wheel left the runway surface and the angle of attack reached 28.9°, the stick pusher activated and commanded a rapid nose-down pitch input.

While the crew was carrying out the ""Before Taxi"" checklist, the ""Start Locks"" task was initiated; however, it was interrupted and not completed.2. After the captain told the first officer to stand by, the crews focus shifted to other tasks. It is likely that this slip of attention resulted in the power levers not being pulled over the flight idle gate to release the start locks.3. The ""Before Taxi"" checklist did not contain a task to ensure that the start locks were removed and, as a result, the crew began taxiing unaware that the propellers were still on the locks.4. After the engine was started or while the occurrence aircraft commenced taxiing for departure, it is likely that slight or rapid transient movements of the engine power levers, which were needed to taxi the aircraft, resulted in the release of the left propeller start locks while the right propeller start locks remained engaged.5. As the power was advanced through 20%, the ""positive torque"" call required by standard operating procedures was not made, and the engine torque differential was not noticed by the crew. As a result, power lever advancement continued although the right engine torque/thrust remained near zero.6. The engaged start locks on the right propeller prevented forward thrust, which resulted in a significant thrust differential. This differential thrust during the take-off roll resulted in a loss of directional control of the aircraft and, ultimately, a lateral runway excursion.7. Following the runway excursion, the propellers, which were operating at a high rpm, shattered and splintered when they struck a frozen snowbank.8. High-energy release of the nickel-cobalt erosion strips and splintered wood core debris from the propeller blades penetrated the reinforcement panel, fuselage skin and cabin wall, and resulted in serious injuries to a passenger sitting next to the penetrated cabin wall",Domestic Scheduled Passenger,TSB Canada ,2020

The flight was conducted in accordance with the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). There were fifteen passengers, two pilots and one cabin crew onboard the aircraft. The accident occurred during landing on the water aerodrome at Kuredu Island Resort.At the time of the accident the water aerodrome was experiencing squally winds and rough seas under sunny conditions, common during the north east monsoon that is typical to the time of the year.The aircraft, while landing on one of the designated (but unmarked) water runways, touched down and bounced. After the bounce, the aircraft banked to the left dipping the left wing-tip into the water and the aircraft veered to the left. The right wing of the aircraft then abruptly dropped with the aircraft nose digging into the water. The captain attempted to initiate a go around after the bounce without success.During the accident the fuselage, wings, engines and propellers of the aircraft sustained substantial damage. Both the floats remained intact and the aircraft was upright after the accident.

The captain was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the first officer was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). On board the aircraft were two additional passengers and a cargo of 16,645 kg. At 0748 local time, the controller issued takeoff clearance. During takeoff roll, about 2 seconds after the PM called the aircraft speed of 80 knots, the pilots felt aircraft vibration, which became severe as the aircraft speed increased. When the aircraft speed was about 110 knots, the PF decided to reject the takeoff and felt that the aircraft direction could not be controlled and the braking was ineffective.The aircraft skidded longitudinally with the nose headed to the right.Thereafter, the aircraft veered to the right and continued until it went off the side of the runway. The aircraft was still moving on the right of the runway shoulder with the nose headed on the runway heading. After crossing taxiway D, the aircraft speed decreased while the aircraft was turning about 360 degrees. The aircraft stopped on the right runway shoulder about 1,600 meters from the beginning of runway 30 on heading 270°.Observing the runway condition, about 500 meters from the beginning runway 30, there was an oscillated wheel mark of both main landing gears and continued until the last position of the aircraft.An investigation of the landing gear showed the upper torsion link and lower torsion link of both main landing gears were separated. Both upper torsion links bent and twisted to the right. The left lower torsion link was fracture while the right lower torsion link broken.

There were five crewmembers onboard comprising the captain, the copilot and the flight engineer on the flight deck, together with a loadmaster and an aircraft engineer who were seated in the galley area. The flight was uneventful and the Aircraft landed at 0845 UTC at HSSJ.Prior to departure, after one hour and 35 minutes on the ground, the captain and the aircraft engineer completed the transit check. The captain noticed oil dripping from the lower fuselage. The aircraft engineer advised the captain that four days before the green hydraulic system tank had been replaced and that the oil was most likely residue from this maintenance action. He assured the captain that the aircraft would be cleaned on arrival in Sharjah.The aircraft departed HSSJ at 1020 UTC for OMSJ. The departure and flight were uneventful until when at FL350 in the Muscat flight information region (FIR), the captain requested a flight level change due to moderate turbulence. According to his statement, immediately after starting the descent, he received a report from the flight engineer that the fluid level in the yellow hydraulic system had rapidly decreased and the ""HYDRAU"" light had illuminated on the master warning panel, followed by an autopilot disconnect. The checklist items for the hydraulic system loss from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were followed and the flight continued manually with the captain as the pilot flying (PF). According to the captain, Air Traffic Control (ATC) was not informed of the hydraulic system loss, but that the flight crew prepared for an extended landing distance of 1.2 times the normal landing distance. The aircraft landed at 1515 UTC at OMSJ on runway 30 and exited on the high-speed taxiway B7.The captain stated that the descent, approach, landing and taxiing to the cargo apron were uneventful, and that the brakes functioned normally. The captain followed the marshallers instructions and stopped the aircraft at the assigned A300 position mark on parking stand 57, in front of the cargo hangar.The captain stated that once the aircraft came to a stop, he applied manual brakes and set the parking brake. While the crew started the parking checklist, the copilot prepared to shut the engines down. When the captain looked up, he realized that the aircraft was moving forward and he applied manual brakes but the aircraft did not stop. He stated that he then steered to the left to avoid the cargo hangar in front of the aircraft but the aircraft continued to move until the No.1 engine collided with a tug which was parked in the equipment area, approximately 36 meters beyond the A300 position mark.An inspection identified that the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter housing, located in the lower fuselage, had fractured and leaked hydraulic fluid.CausesThe Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates determines that the causes of the Aircraft collision with a parking tow tug and the consequent substantial damage were(a) The uncontrolled movement of the Aircraft by engine idle thrust beyond the parking stop line.(b) The Aircraft could not be maintained at rest after the initial stop because the selected parking brake was not operational due to a leak from a fracture in the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter head, and a failure of the accumulator system of the parking brake that could not be determined during the Investigation.(c) The Aircraft could not be stopped by manual braking because that the Manual brake was disabled after the flight crew selected the Parking brake without prior confirmation that adequate parking pressure was available.3.4 Contributing Factors to the AccidentThe Investigation identified that the following were contributing factors to the Accident(a) Airbus had identified the design of the high-pressure filter head as one of two contributors to fractures developing at the head flange, but did not address this issue with equal priority.(b) The marshaller was not prepared to place wheel chocks on the Aircrafts arrival at the parking bay and was therefore unable to react timely to obstruct the movement of the Aircraft.28-02-202028-02-2020",Cargo,GCAA UAE ,2020

The crew flew a maximum effort (assault) landing at Ramstein Air Base and experienced a hard landing with a vertical acceleration load factor (g-load) exceedance value of 3.62 times the force of gravity (g) and a landing sink rate of 834 feet per minute exceeding the  aircrafts maximum allowable landing limits of 540 fpm and g-load of 2.0g. Immediately upon touchdown, the crew executed a go-around and coordinated with Air Traffic Control for a visual approach, full-stop landing. The aircraft landed safely at 1737.The landing g-load exceedance resulted in significant damage to the center wing, both outer wings, left and right main landing gear assemblies, and engines, to include mounting structures. The estimated damages are $20,917,089.The crew of this mission was scheduled to fly in a formation of three C-130Js planning to conduct two training routes. The primary training objective for the local sortie was to complete the pilots evaluation. The crew planned to takeoff early as a single-ship, conduct a maximum effort takeoff followed by a maximum effort landing using the painted landing zone marked on the runway as required for the evaluation, full-stop, and then rejoin the formation in order to complete the remainder of the evaluation requirements in the formation. Preflight, engine start, taxi and the Ramstein AB visual traffic pattern procedures were executed within good flying standards and were procedurally correct. The mishap occurred during the maximum effort landing.The Accident Investigation Board President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the pilot's early engine power reduction (power pull), beginning at 70 feet above ground level (AGL) and fully flight idle at 45 feet AGL. In addition, the board president found, by the preponderance of evidence, that the evaluated pilot and other pilots failure to identify the excessive sink rate and their failure to arrest the excessive sink rate or go-around in a timely manner were substantially contributing factors that resulted in the aircraft exceeding the C-130J-30 g-load and sink rate landing limits.23-04-2020",Military,USAF AIB ,2020

The pilot sustained no injury. The flight departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP), Texas, at 2004 with 631 lbs of cargo and a fuel load of 2,800 lbs. During the initial climb, the captain selected the landing gear handle to the UP position to retract the landing gear. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the captain attempted to cycle the landing gear handle once more yielding the same result. Following the second unsuccessful gear retraction, the captain elected to leave the landing gear handle in the DOWN position and continued to the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), Texas, where more services would be available if needed. The airplane climbed to 8,000 ft mean sea level and cruised below the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE).As the captain began to prepare for arrival at SAT, he retrieved the arrival automatic terminal information service (ATIS). The ATIS was reporting gusting winds out of the north, clear skies, and runway 4 as the active arrival runway. The captain began the descent toward the airport and air traffic control cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 4. The pilot entered a dogleg right base and completed the before landing checklist noting three green lights and no red lights, which indicated the landing gear was down, locked, and safe for landing.The airplane touched down around the aiming point marker on runway 4. As the main landing gear touched down on the dry concrete, the left main landing gear collapsed, the red unsafe light in the landing gear handle illuminated, and was followed by an aural horn indicating the landing gear was now unlocked and unsafe for landing. Simultaneously, the airplane began to dip toward the left, causing the left wing tip to contact the runway. The impact on the airplane resulted in the airplane's momentum taking the airplane from the runway centerline off the runway and into the grass area several thousand ft from the runway 4 threshold. Once the airplane came to a complete stop, the captain shutdown all power to the airplane and exited through the main entry air stairs.The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.A postaccident damage assessment by the operator revealed that the left main landing gear brace was fractured.08-05-202008-05-2020",Cargo,NTSB ,2020

The pilot was not injured. After a normal instrument flight rules (IFR), 2-hour flight from Gainesville, Florida (GNV), the pilot was setting up to land at his final destination Houston International Airport, Texas (HOU). The pilot reported that during his final approach to runway 13, he lowered the landing gear and received 2 of 3 green lights on his landing gear position indicators. The left main landing gear light was not illuminated and a warning horn sounded. The pilot recycled the landing gear with the same result. He reported the situation to HOU tower and asked if they could visually see whether all three landing gear were down. The pilot stated that the HOU tower affirmed that all three landing gear were down. The pilot also stated that a commercial airliner that was taxiing toward the main terminal radioed that they observed all three landing gear were down.The pilot reported that according to the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), he initiated an aggressive bank right, followed abruptly by a bank left in an attempt to generate sufficient lateral G-force on the landing gear.

There were 91 passengers on board and 8 crew members. Two passengers survived the accident.The flight departed Lahore at 1305 hours local time (0805 UTC) and was expected to arrive at Karachi about 1445 (0945 UTC). Departure from Lahore and cruising flight were uneventful. The flight crew did not follow standard callouts and did not observe CRM aspects during most parts of flight. According to the Pakistani Aviation Minister, the crew were engaged in conversations related to the coronavirus.The controller at Karachi East Area Control cleared the flight for the Nawabshah 2A arrival procedure, and advised to expect an ILS approach for runway 25L. The flight was later cleared at pilot's discretion to report direct MAKLI, a waypoint 15 nautical miles at a radial of 075 from the Karachi VOR, and descend to FL100, and later re-cleared for FL50. The aircraft changed over to the Karachi Approach controller and was cleared to descend down to 3000 ft, before reaching MAKLI.The aircraft ended up higher than the required descend profile. At MAKLI the aircraft was at 9780 ft and at about 245 knots IAS. In order to manage the descent and lose the additional height, the OPEN DES mode was selected via the FCU, both autopilots were disengaged and speed brakes were extended.Karachi Approach inquired ""confirm track mile comfortable for descend"" and later advised to take an orbit, so that the aircraft could capture the required descent profile. No orbit was executed and the effort to intercept the glide slope and ILS localizer was continued. At 7221 ft at around 10.5 NM from runway 25L the undercarriage was extended.Karachi Approach advised repeatedly about the excessive height but the flight continued the approach.At an altitude of 1740 feet and at a distance slightly less than 5 nautical miles from runway 25L the undercarriage as raised. At this time, the aircraft had intercepted the localizer as well as theglide slope. Flaps 1 were selected at 243 knots IAS. Over-speed and EGPWS warnings were then triggered.Since the approach to land was continued, Karachi Approach instead of changing over the aircraft to the Tower controller, contacted Karachi Tower by phone to request landing clearance.The Tower controller confirmed clearance to land without observing the abnormality that the landing gears were not extended. Karachi Approach then cleared the aircraft to land.At 500 ft, the airspeed was 220 knots IAS at a slat/flap configuration 3, and a descent rate of 2000 ft/min. Several warnings and alerts sounded in the cockpit, such as overspeed, landing gear not down and ground proximity alerts. The landing was carried out with landing gears retracted. The aircraft touched the runway surface on its engines. The flight crew applied reverse engine power and initiated a braking action. Both engines scraped the runway at various locations causing damage to both of them. The Tower controller observed the gear-up landing and contacted the Karachi Approach controller by phone. Subsequently Karachi Approach did not relay this to the flight crew.The landing was discontinued and a go-around was executed. At 1435 the flight crew radioed that they were going around and requested another ILS approach to runway 25L. The controller instructed the flight to turn left heading 110 and climb to 3000 feet. Four minutes later the flight reported they had ""lost engines"" and subsequently declared a Mayday. The controller cleared the flight to land with both runways (25L and 25R) available.Both engines failed one by one and subsequently the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed to power the essential aircraft systems. The aircraft was not able to reach the runway and crashed about 1340 meters short of runway 25L in a residential area named Model Colony.

After cruising for approximately 59 minutes, the aircraft began its descent into Camp Taji, Iraq. During descent, the crew leveled off at 3700 feet mean sea level (MSL) and reduced throttles to flight idle. The copilot slowed and configured the aircraft for a night vision device (NVD) approach and landing with flaps set to 100 percent. The aircraft's highest recorded airspeed during this approach was 157 Knots Indicated Air Speed (KIAS), although the maximum recommended airspeed with the wing flaps set to 100 percent is 145 KIAS. At approximately two nautical miles (NM) from the airfield, the aircraft was 1000 feet above the recommended glideslope for runway 34 and at 150 KIAS, and remained above glideslope until landing. The reported tailwind for runway 34 at Camp Taji was 10 knots, with a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius. The aircraft crossed the runway 34 threshold at a ground speed of 161 knots (151 KIAS); the recommended calculated landing velocity for the aircraft at its weight (122,000 pounds) was 105 KIAS.The crew attempted to land the aircraft at higher than optimal speed with a nose-down attitude. The aircraft's excessive air speed continued to generate lift on the aircraft and caused it to porpoise upon touchdown, which prevented the aircraft's braking system from engaging due to a lack of proper weight on the wheels. Thirteen seconds after touchdown -eight seconds of which were spentporpoising- the aircraft began to slow as expected, once the engines were placed in reverse and when the wheels then received adequate weight to engage the anti-skid brakes. However, by that point there was insufficient runway remaining (less than 1000 feet) and the aircraft departed the prepared surface, whereupon it came to a stop only when it struck a 12-foot-high concrete barrier approximately 600 feet past the end of the runway, at approximately 2205 local time. All 26 individuals onboard the aircraft survived the mishap and egressed, with only relatively minor injuries to two individuals.CONCLUSION by AIB PresidentAfter a comprehensive investigation into this mishap, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of the mishap was the aircrafts excess indicated airspeed on approach, which developed into the subsequent floating and ""porpoising"" of the aircraft after touchdown, further resulting in continued lift and insufficient WOW to apply braking action.Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the crew's failure to adequately assess risk, failure to follow proper procedures, and poor communication were all substantially contributing factors to this mishap. The crew failed to recognize, and appropriately respond to or correct the aircraft's excess airspeed on the approach, or to take control of the aircraft and call for/conduct a ""go-around"" once the approach and landing was deemed untenable.08-06-2020",Military,USAF AIB ,2020

On 16 June 2020, the aircraft was to be flown empty to Weeze Airport, Germany where it was to be placed back into storage.Prior to boarding the aircraft, the pilots had checked that wheel chocks were fitted to the mainwheels and nosewheels. In the cockpit, the parking brake lever was confirmed as being set to the park position and whilst the commander reviewed the aircraft technical log, the co-pilot started the APU. The pilots checked the cockpit multi-function display (MFD) and noted that the fluid quantities of the hydraulic systems were adequate. Neither pilot noticed what the park brake hydraulic system pressure was indicating on the MFD, but this was not required to be checked until the end of the aircraft power-on checks and prior to starting the first engine.The representative of the aircrafts owner and the dispatcher then proceeded to remove the chocks from all wheels. The pilots, onboard the aircraft, had not seen the chocks being removed. About 15 minutes after the chocks had been removed, the commander exited the aircraft to start his walkaround inspection. This included visual checks of the nosewheel tyres and the park brake accumulator pressure gauge, which indicated about 500 psi. Whilst the commander spoke with the engineers, the co-pilot then carried out a walkaround inspection.Neither pilot had authorised the removal of any wheel chocks, and neither noticed that all the wheel chocks had been removed during the walkaround. As the pilots completed the load sheet, the dispatcher boarded the aircraft via the forward left cabin door and stood near the cockpit entrance. The owner representative then noticed that the aircraft was starting to move forward and shouted to the dispatcher who alerted the pilots. Both pilots applied the toe brakes and the commander moved the park brake lever off and back to park twice, but the aircraft continued to roll forward. The commander recalled that, as the aircraft had started to move, he had noticed that the park brake hydraulic system pressure on the MFD was 0 psi. The commander also tried to steer using the tiller, but the aircraft did not respond.Having seen the aircraft start to move, the three engineers left their vehicle and ran to the adjacent right landing gear, where they tried to stop the aircraft by pushing and pulling against its main strut. As the representative ran to the vehicle to get some chocks, the dispatcher jumped from the cabin door and moved to the left gear where he pushed against its strut. However, the aircraft continued to gather speed as it crossed Taxiway D whilst heading towards the parked and empty aircraft, Embraer ERJ-145EP G-SAJS. The dispatcher then ran to the front of the aircraft, where he was joined by one of the engineers, who tried to slow the aircraft by pushing against the aircraft nose. A few second later, the engineers and dispatcher ran clear of G-JECK as it approached G-SAJS.At a ground speed of about 5 kt, G-JECK struck the underside of G-SAJS's No 2 engine, causing its right landing gear to be lifted clear of the ground. G-JECK came to a stop with the No 2 engine of G-SAJS resting on top of its forward fuselage. There were no injuries.ConclusionG-JECK rolled across Taxiway D from its parking position and struck G-SAJS because the nosewheel chocks had been inadvertently removed, and the hydraulic pressure in the park brake accumulator had depleted over several days to the point where it was unable to prevent the aircraft from moving on the 1° slope.16-06-202016-06-2020",Ferry/positioning,AAIB ,2020

Both pilots and nineteen passengers died in the accident.The flight departed Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates at 1015 UTC on a passenger service to Kozhikode-Calicut Airport.The aircraft arrived from the west, overflying the airport at 1342 UTC. It then performed a teardrop approach to runway 28. This approach was discontinued and the aircraft subsequently flew a teardrop approach to runway 10. According to a DGCA official the aircraft touched down about 900 meters down the 2850 m long runway at 1410 UTC (1940 local time). The aircraft failed to stop on the remaining runway and overran. It went down a 34 m dropoff and broke in two.WeatherWeather at the time of the approaches and landing was poor. At 1400 UTC scattered clouds were reported at 300 and 1200 feet with a few Cumulonimbus clouds at 2500 feet and overcast clouds at 8000 feet. The wind was from 260 degrees at 12 knots. Visibility was 2000 m in rain.Airport and runwayThe airport has a single runway (10/28) which is located on a flattened hill. The Landing Distance Available (LDA) for both directions is 2850 m. The runway strip extended to 60 m beyond the threshold. After the paved surface, there is a runway endsafety area (RESA), measuring 93 m x 90 m. The ICAO required RESA length is 90 m, whereas the recommended length is 240 m.Past the RESA there is a 35 m drop off.PROBABLE CAUSEThe probable cause of the accident was the non adherence to SOP by the PF, wherein, he continued an unstabilized approach and landed beyond the touchdown zone, half way down the runway, in spite of Go Around call by PM which warranted a mandatory Go Around and the failure of the PM to take over controls and execute a Go Around.CONTRIBUTORY FACTORSThe investigation team is of the opinion that the role of systemic failures as a contributory factor cannot be overlooked in this accident. A large number of similar accidents/incidents that have continued to take place, more so in AIXL, reinforce existing systemic failures within the aviation sector. These usually occur due to prevailing safety culture that give rise to errors, mistakes and violation of routine tasks performed by people operating within the system. Hence, the contributory factors enumerated below include both the immediate causes and the deeper or systemic causes.(i) The actions and decisions of the PIC were steered by a misplaced motivation to land back at Kozhikode to operate next day morning flight AXB 1373. The unavailability of sufficient number of Captains at Kozhikode was the result of faulty AIXL HR policy which does not take into account operational requirement while assigning permanent base to its Captains. There was only 01 Captain against 26 First Officers on the posted strength at Kozhikode. (ii) The PIC had vast experience of landing at Kozhikode under similar weather conditions. This experience might have led to over confidence leading to complacency and a state of reduced conscious attention that would have seriously affected his actions, decision making as well as CRM. (iii) The PIC was taking multiple un-prescribed anti-diabetic drugs that could have probably caused subtle cognitive deficits due to mild hypoglycaemia which probably contributed to errors in complex decision making as well as susceptibility to perceptual errors. (iv) The possibility of visual illusions causing errors in distance and depth perception (like black hole approach and up-sloping runway) cannot be ruled out due to degraded visual cues of orientation due to low visibility and suboptimal performance of the PICs windshield wiper in rain. (v) Poor CRM was a major contributory factor in this crash. As a consequence of lack of assertiveness and the steep authority gradient in the cockpit, the First Officer did not take over the controls in spite of being well aware of the grave situation. The lack of effective CRM training of AIXL resulted in poor CRM and steep cockpit gradient. (vi) AIXL policies of upper level management have led to a lack of supervision in training, operations and safety practices, resulting in deficiencies at various levels causing repeated human error accidents in AIXL (vii) The AIXL pilot training program lacked effectiveness and did not impart the requisite skills for performance enhancement. One of the drawbacks in training was inadequate maintenance and lack of periodic system upgrades of the simulator. Frequently recurring major snags resulted in negative training. Further, pilots were often not checked for all the mandatory flying exercises during simulator check sessions by the Examiners. (viii) The non availability of OPT made it very difficult for the pilots to quickly calculate accurate landing data in the adverse weather conditions. The quick and accurate calculations would have helped the pilots to foresee the extremely low margin for error, enabling them to opt for other safer alternative. (ix) The scrutiny of Tech Logs and Maintenance Record showed evidence of nonstandard practice of reporting of certain snags through verbal briefing rather than in writing. There was no entry of windshield wiper snag in the Tech log of VT-AXH. Though it could not be verified, but a verbal briefing regarding this issue is highly probable. (x) The DATCO changed the runway in use in a hurry to accommodate the departure of AIC 425 without understanding the repercussions on recovery of AXB 1344 in tail winds on a wet runway in rain. He did not caution AXB 1344 of prevailing strong tail winds and also did not convey the updated QNH settings. (xi) Accuracy of reported surface winds for runway 10 was affected by installation of wind sensor in contravention to the laid down criteria in CAR. This was aggravated by frequent breakdown due to poor maintenance. (xii) The Tower Met Officer (TMO) was not available in the ATC tower at the time of the accident. The airfield was under two concurrent weather warnings and it is mandatory for the TMO to be present to update and inform the fast changing weather variations to enhance air safety. During adverse weather conditions the presence of the TMO in the ATC tower was even more critical. (xiii) The AAI has managed to fulfil ICAO and DGCA certification requirements at Kozhikode aerodrome for certain critical areas like RESA, runway lights and approach lights. Each of these, in isolation fulfils the safety criteria however, when considered in totality, this left the aircrew of AXB 1344 with little or no margin for error. Although not directly contributory to the accident causation, availability of runway centreline lights would have certainly enhanced the spatial orientation of the PIC. (xiv) The absence of a detailed proactive policy and clear cut guidelines by the Regulator on monitoring of Long Landings at the time of the accident was another contributory factor in such runway overrun accidents. Long Landing has been major factor in various accidents and incidents involving runway excursion since 2010 and has not been addressed in CAR Section 5, Series F, Part II. (xv) DGCA did not comprehensively revise CAR Section 5, Series F, Part II Issue I, dated 30 Sep 99  (Rev. on 26 Jul 2017) on Monitoring of DFDR/QAR/PMR Data for Accident/Incident Prevention to address the recommendations of the COI of 2010 AIXL Managlore Crash regarding the exceedance limits, resulting in the persisting ambiguities in this matter. (xvi) DFDR data monitoring for prevention of accidents/incidents is done by AIXL. However 100% DFDR monitoring is not being done, in spite of the provisions laid down in the relevant CAR and repeated audit observations by DGCA. DFDR data monitoring is the most effective tool to identify exceedance and provide suitable corrective training in order to prevent runway accidents like the crash of AXB 1344. However, ATR submitted by AIXL on the said findings were accepted by DGCA year after year without ascertaining its implementation or giving due importance to its adverse implications.07-08-2020",Int'l Non Scheduled Passenger,AAIB India ,2020

The aircraft had departed from its base in Castelo Branco, Portugal, at 0815 together with another CL-215. On approaching the area of the fire, the two aircraft used the Lindoso reservoir to load water. The direction of loading was southwest and the area where they were dropping to water load was on a northeast-facing slope. After dropping some loads, the Portuguese Fire Coordinator asked the crew of EC-HET to go and drop the water in an area further south. The aircraft made a turn to a heading of 100° and entered a narrow valley in which they were stuck without being able to turn to either side, so they continued their flight up the valley. During the climb up the valley the aircraft had its flaps deployed in the 10° position and had a tailwind of 3 kt. Prior to impact, the flaps were fully deployed. When the aircraft was 150 m away from the crest, it hit the ground with the tail, causinf the tail assembly to detach. After the first impact, the aircraft touched the ground with the lower fuselage and tilted on the lower fuselage raising its rear end to a near vertical position and the cockpit impacted the ground and crushed. The commander was able to exit the aircraft under his own power and pulled the co-pilot out of the aircraft. The impact caused a fire around the aircraft which was extinguished by some of the aerial resources that were in the area and by the components of a forest fire fighting brigade that was transported by one of the helicopters on its way to the area and which was landed near the site of the accident. The co-pilot died approximately one hour after the impact, close to the crash site, while being treated by the emergency services. The Commander was transferred by helicopter to a hospital in Portugal.Causes/Contributing factorsThe investigation has determined that the accident was due to an erroneous assessment of the aircraft's ability to climb over the mountain.08-08-2020",Fire fighting,CIAIAC ,2020

The gear in transit light illuminated and the two green main landing gear indicator lights extinguished, but the nose landing gear green light remained illuminated. The crew requested and received a block of airspace from air traffic services to trouble shoot the issue. The flight crew subsequently selected the landing gear down, to which they heard some abnormal mechanical sounds and the status of the landing gear indication lights remained unchanged. The captain elected to perform a flyby of the control tower in an attempt to get visual confirmation of the landing gear position. The tower reported that the landing gear appeared to be in the extended position. The flight crew then completed the manual extension of the landing gear in accordance with the abnormal procedures, but was unable to cycle the manual extension handle. The flight crew informed the passengers that they would be returning to CYEG and conducted a passenger briefing as there was a concern the landing gear was not fully extended and may collapse/retract on landing. At approximately 1505MST, an approach and touch down on runway 20 was subsequently conducted. The captain felt the left side main landing gear collapsing and executed a go around.

The towing route followed the edge of the apron, which was damp and downhill, and involved a 90° left turn to line up for start. A combination of unfamiliarity with a relatively new operating base, towing in reverse and difficulty interpreting ""indistinct"" taxiway markings meant the tug driver entered the left turn later than intended. The late entry made the turn excessively tight, and the tug lost traction on the damp surface and jack-knifed. The resulting combination of a sharp towing angle and the aircrafts downhill momentum caused the towbar shear pin to break. The commander applied the brakes immediately on hearing ""the sound of snapping metal"" but was unable to prevent the aircraft rolling forward into the tug.The operators internal investigation report made several safety recommendations, including a review of towing procedures, enhanced driver training, the use of radios by towing teams and improvements to taxiway markings.

At 105427, when the airplane was about 3 miles north of the airport, a departure controller contacted the airplane and asked if they were ""on frequency."" The pilot responded with, ""N66BK with you."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn right to a heading 130°; however, the pilot did not acknowledge. At 105446, the controller asked the pilot if he ""copied"" the heading instruction. The pilot responded about 4 seconds later and said, ""130...Bravo Kilo.""At 105511, the controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain 15,000 ft msl, but there was no response. The controller then made multiple attempts to re-establish communications with the airplane; however, there were no further communications.A review of radar data revealed that after the pilot established contact with departure control the airplane made a series of heading changes along with several climbs and descents before it entered a steep, descending left turn. The last radar return, at 105505, indicated the airplane  was at an altitude of about 700 ft msl, descending about 31,000 ft-per-minute, on a heading of090°.A witness was fishing about 150 ft west of the Fate Sanders Recreation Area boat ramp located on Lake Percy Priest, about 2.7 miles northeast of MQY.

Safety pin in front landing gear in wrong hole while changing some parts, was the cause of the collapse. No reported injuries and the aircraft had last performed cargo flight BAW881 from Moscow on June 16th. It had been parked out on the airport ever since its arrival. The aircraft was loading freight prior to departing for Frankfurt, Germany (FRA/EDDF) on Flight BA906.The aircraft was being loaded with cargo in preparation for a flight to Frankfurt, and whilst carrying out a Dispatch Deviation Guide (DDG) procedure to clear maintenance messages relating to an existing Acceptable Deferred Defect (ADD), the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) retracted. This caused damage to the lower nose, NLG doors and engine cowlings. Door 2 left (Door 2L) struck the top platform of the mobile steps, positioned at the door, which resulted in the door separating from the fuselage and one person, operating the cargo loader positioned at the forward cargo hold, received minor injuries.The DDG procedure required the cockpit landing gear selection lever to be cycled with hydraulic power applied to the aircraft. To prevent the landing gear from retracting, the procedure required pins to be inserted in the nose and main landing gear downlocks. However, the NLG downlock pin was installed in the NLG downlock apex pin bore which was adjacent to the correct location to install the downlock pin. When the landing gear selector was cycled the NLG retracted.An Airworthiness Directive had been issued, with a 36-month compliance from 16 January 2020, to install an insert over the apex pin bore to prevent incorrect installation of the downlock pin, but this had not yet been implemented on G-ZBJB.18-06-202118-06-202118-06-2021",Cargo,,2021

On the return leg the captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and the co-pilot Pilot Monitoring (PM).After take-off from runway 23 at Kavala at 194215 hrs local time, the pilots were not able to retract the landing gear. The landing gear lever was blocked in position DOWN and the co-pilot could not move it into position UP. Shortly after that, the ECAM message L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT was triggered. At 194239 hrs, the captain switched on the autopilot (AP1) at 930 ft AMSL, which disengaged again automatically 8 seconds later. The ECAM messages AUTO FLT AP OFF and AUTO FLT A/THR OFF were triggered. Afterwards it was not possible to engage one of the two autopilots or the autothrust system. For the remainder of the flight the airplane was controlled manually. During climb, the co-pilot informed Kavala Tower that they could not retract the landing gear. At 194332 hrs, the captain reduced speed to 220 kt and the flight was continued in runway direction.Then the ECAM L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT procedure was performed. The pilots determined that all three landing gears were indicated as extended and locked. This was confirmed by the landing gear indication panel and the image on the ECAM WHEEL page.At 195015 hrs, the pilots levelled off at FL 100. In agreement with the tower controller they flew within the 25 NM radius of VOR KPL above the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) along radials of VOR KPL with headings almost parallel to the runway. VOR KPL was overflown several times. Support with radar vectors was not possible, because there was no radar coverage in that area.The pilots decided to land at Kavala again with the technical fault present.It was not clear to the pilots which landing gear was affected by the ECAM message L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT. The co-pilot assumed a landing gear shock absorber fault at one of the two main landing gears. The pilots discussed a potential connection with the rejected take-off the day before at Heraklion.The co-pilot informed the tower controller about their decision to land at Kavala again. As precautionary action, the flight crew requested the fire brigade. Since the tower controller asked the flight crew for a Mayday call in order to alert the fire brigade, the co-pilot declared emergency after consulting with the captain.The captain transferred manual control of the airplane to the co-pilot and then informed the cabin crew and the passengers of their decision to return to Kavala. The captain prepared and briefed the VOR-DME approach to runway 23 of Kavala Airport. After taking back control, he performed the approach.At 203503 hrs the landing with the main landing gear occurred. After touch-down of the nose landing gear the further movement of the nose gear into the shock absorber felt unusually hard. The airplane was decelerated with full reverse and auto brake medium. According to the statement of the flight crew, during taxiing lack of damping of the nose landing gear could be felt.After the airplane had been parked, a deflated nose landing gear shock absorber and structural damage at the front area of the fuselage, especially in the area of Frame 20, was determined. At this time, there was no visible leakage of the nose landing gear shock absorber.The day before, on July 10, 2021, the accident aircraft had been involved in a rejected takeoff incident at Heraklion Airport. The flight crew rejected the takeoff at a speed of 137 kt CAS, 2 kt below the decision speed V1. The captain also pulled the side stick back, causing the nose landing gear to lift off. She then pushed the side stick forward and the nose landing gear touched down again. During ground contact, the airplane was in a yaw movement towards the left in the direction of the runway centre.

The sole pilot onboard was fatally injured.At 1254 hrs local time, the pilot took off from Borkum Airfield. On board were the pilot and 12 skydivers, which were dropped at FL 140 above Norderney Island. It was planned to drop the skydivers, land at Norderney Airfield, pick them up again and then fly back to Borkum.At about 1305 hrs, after the airplane had reached the dropping altitude above Norderney Airfield on a westerly heading, ground speed decreased to marginally below 100 kt and the skydivers were dropped. One minute later, in agreement with the radar controller, the airplane began a left-hand descent turn to a south-easterly heading and started to decrease altitude. Mean rate of descent was 4,000 ft/min and mean ground speed 160 kt. At 1307 hrs at FL 90, the pilot signed off with the radar controller. At the time, the airplane reached the main land on a south-eastern heading. The descent was conducted as drawn-out left-hand turn in order to overfly the dyke on a north-western heading towards Norderney. Once he reached the Wadden Sea again, the pilot began to decrease rate of descent and speed and radioed Norderney Airfield for the base leg of runway 26.At 130949 hrs, the airplane was last captured as secondary radar signal at 232 ft AMSL with a ground speed of about 150 kt by military radar.Several witnesses, who were on land, at the island or close by on the water, told about an airplane flying with high speed low above the mud flat. One witness, who was on his boat in close proximity, observed the approach and crash. He stated that the airplane had flown into the water in swift straight flight with consistent engine and propeller noises and a pitch angle of about 30°.
