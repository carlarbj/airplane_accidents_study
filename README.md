# Airplane Occurrences
## Objectives:
 To compare occurrences that happen on the Landing and En Route Phases, their fatality rates and 

## Status:

## Tools used:
 *Pandas library
 
 *Regular expressions
 
 *Filters

 *Tableau
 
 *Selenium

## Step-by-step:
 
 First I collected all the data from the occurrences of the past 10 years and cleaned them in order to have accidents separated by phase of flight, kind of damage, and the code of the airport occurrence, to make an interactive map. 
 
 Analyzing the data there were some highlights. 
 - Between 2019 and 2020 there is a rising in the occurrences of private flights; 
 - In 2021 flights the number of flights rise but the number of occurrences doesn't; 
 - The landing phase has a lot more occurrences then the en route phase, but en route is way more fatal;
 - En route fatalities tend to get lower, while landing numbers don't follow an specific pattern;
 - En route occurrences tend to vary, while landing numbers tend to follow the same average every year;

 
## Conclusion:
Occurrences in landing are more likely to happen even though it's not the most fatal one. (En Route and Approach show higher numbers). Still, the occurrence may become a serious incident or an accident depending on the location of the airport, such as close to cliffs, roads, crowded places, and so on, and also, there are technologies that can avoid worse situations onde a runway excursion happen, such as RESAs and EMAS.


# Questions that still need answer and other topics to study.
 Why was there a rise in the number of occurrences in private flights between 2019 and 2020;
 Further investigaation on Approach occurrences, which is the second most fatal phase.
